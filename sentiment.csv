1,357843,2021-07-30,I had a wonderful time staying in Haydee's apartment. It was clean and had everything I needed for a 2 week stay.
2,715962,2019-04-23,"Jesse’s place was great! The place was very (Hidden by Airbnb) -friendly (decor was super stylish and brag-worthy) and the little kitty that lives there is lovely! It was about a (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) minute walk to the subway (with at least 5 great coffee/bagel/donut places along the way) and anther 15 minutes into midtown Manhattan (Times Square). The ladder to get the bed was a bit of an upper body test and may not be for the faint of heart but the bed was very comfy and the place was pretty quiet (despite another review; it was mostly noisy during the day when we were already heading out around 9am). Overall, would definitely recommend and would stay again!"
3,687883,2019-01-13,"For just a room rental, for the most part felt pretty private. I checked in really late and didn't have any issues. Host were very responsive and check-in was easy. Place was cute and comfortable. Wasn't a ton of parking in the area but we did find one a few doors down so I was happy. I would def recommend to stay here for anyone looking into the area."
4,744817,2021-10-17,Host does not make clear that there are others and how many who are living there long term and utilizing the same unvented bathroom which is entered through kitchen. One apparently long term renter rude re sharing bathroom.

6,811293,2021-04-21,amazing stay. great location
7,269296,2019-09-19,"Nice place to stay in Brooklyn. Ideal for two guests, who are not a couple because of the possibility to use a second bedroom. It was clean and cozy and the next Metrostation within walking distance. We are only giving 4 stars, as the balcony was unfurnished and could therefore not be used. Noise-sensitive people might be bothered by the aircraft noise from early in the morning till past midnight. Izabel is a very good host and always available when needed."
8,295986,2021-10-24,"Lovely garden apartment in a great area. Very comfortable and the hosts are very kind. Good communication throughout. Check in and out is simple. Some notes: parking can be challenging in that neighborhood. But you're right near several subways, which is a better way to get around NYC! Kitchen is pretty basic, but okay for basic food prep. TV is a bit fiddly to set up. Overall a great place to stay! We would definitely consider coming back there."
9,767634,2019-12-22,"Easy to get into, clean, close to all the trains to bkln or Manhattan, decent food options."
10,550236,2019-09-22,"Very clean, place looks like picture. Easy access to subway but not quickly accessible to other boroughs."

12,74333,2019-09-30,Page is a very kind & accommodating host. The apartment is in a perfect location as we walked to all the mid town places. The subway is a 1 minutes walk so I would highly recommend this place to stay.
13,838270,2021-07-11,Convenient location and space! Would stay again.
14,784043,2021-05-26,"Very cute place. It’s in a basement so the ceilings are low and the apt has close neighbors, but other than that the space is just as pictured. Very cute and a great value."
15,731858,2021-10-18,"Kevin and his airbnb are a blessing. He is such a kind host. He will help you with any info. you need. You will not regret booking with him. His place is right in Chinatown, convenient to walk around. Will return here when we visit New York again."

18,304900,2019-05-20,"This place was exactly as pictured and described. Convenient location as we were able to explore a bit of Brooklyn, Coney Island and easily make our way to Manhattan. Not a bad drive to both JFK and Newark Airports. I received fast responses from our host. Very pleased with our stay!"
19,469840,2019-08-11,Michelle is great! We enjoyed meeting her and staying at her place. The neighborhood was great too. The apartment has authentic character which we love! We really enjoyed nagels bagels and el jefe Mexican food near by. <br/><br/>Thank you for the hospitality Michelle!
20,839065,2021-06-17,I liked staying here a lot! The bathroom was great and the room was clean. The description is accurate and the host has great communication. I liked that the subway station was a 5 minute walk and the AC unit was such a great addition in this hot weather. A wonderful NYC find!
21,715025,2021-10-24,The Airbnb is perfectly located right where it matters as you can easily explore anywhere in NYC within all the boroughs if you choose from the comforts of being in the upper west side. Sharone was extremely flexible and accommodating which made for a truly enjoyable time. My only complaint is I did book a longer trip. :)
22,98913,2019-04-05,Tolle Unterkunft in herausragender Lage direkt in Manhattan. Typische New Yorker Wohnung. Michael war ein toller Host und hat uns viele nützliche Tipps gegeben um unseren Trip noch besser zu machen. Ich Kann die Unterkunft zu 100 Prozent weiterempfehlen.
23,432927,2019-12-12,"I love Mei’s place- this is my second time booking there which says it all.  Super clean, super efficient and wonderfully friendly.  I will definitely stay here again and again!"
24,254346,2020-07-17,"Fantastic location right in the middle of all the action. I thoroughly enjoyed my two month stay here. There is a subway station right below the building and a parking garage where I could rent a monthly parking spot for $250/Month. The apartment was super clean and comfy, Steve was a great hot, very responsive and accommodating. Loved it overall!"
25,865083,2021-08-23,"OMG!!! It was a hurricane weekend & needed a place to stay with my two good friends.  I found this place & boy was it AMAZING! The house is beautiful & what you see in photos matches in person.  The house smells good, the space is clean & comfy. Best part of the house is the master bedroom where I ended up taking pictures for nice background.  I will definitely revisit!"
26,584596,2019-09-26,"This is an amazing apartment with a wonderful garden and Ruth is the most gracious host! The apartment has everything one might need and then some - bar soap, facial wash, q-tips, cotton pads - and feels like home. Ruth welcomed us despite the late hour of arrival and showed us around. Location is perfect and certainly a place we would love to return to."
27,378119,2019-06-18,Convenient and clean.
28,867056,2021-11-01,"The place is amazing, just as in the pictures, the space is very big and everything in soho is walking distance. William was very attentive and responded immediately if anything was needed. The check in was quick and easy. Very comfortable place, the beds are amazing! Complete kitchen. There are 3 bedrooms and 2 complete bathrooms. Laundry as well. I will definitely recommend this place ! Hope to be back soon."
29,368356,2019-10-16,"J. was a great host. He offered lots of tips on what to do in the city and in Harlem, and was responsive to my messages. His apartment was very clean and well-situated within the neighborhood, as we were close to the 2/3 trains. Thanks for a great stay!"
30,859816,2021-11-06,"Enjoyed my stay so much I rebooked for a few more days. Nice spacious place, clean and in a good location."
31,714018,2019-12-08,Very responsive host and warmly decorated interior.
32,809285,2020-03-06,I Recommend times 50 was a really nice place to stay great people quiet house and clean and a good area not too far from the city and just amazing
33,474604,2019-04-14,Kevin is a great host. He picked me up from a local metro station and dropped me at the house. I enjoyed playing basketball in the yard with his son. There is a code to let you in and there are a few places selling nice soul food in the area. Kevin also dropped me airport the next day which was a very short drive.
34,653217,2019-10-30,"Jeff ist sehr nett, hilfsbereit und zuverlässig. Die Wohnung liegt sehr verkehrsgünstig und ist trotzdem relativ ruhig und in einer sicheren Gegend. Das Bad ist allerdings etwas klein."
35,446755,2021-01-31,"Perfect and safe area to stay! Very clean, plenty of space, and comfortable rooms. Will surely be booking this every time I am in the area."

37,376966,2019-03-31,Hans’ place is a great spot to stay if you are interested in exploring tha UES. The street is quiet and so close to Central Park. Lots of nearby taking options of you arrive by car.
38,741188,2019-08-04,Gréât place to stay. Geralde provided super cool snacks. House  and kitchen are clean.
39,613754,2020-02-21,"Great place overall, Nkem was extremely helpful and made my stay easy, the room was bigger than expected and has a good amount of natural light in the morning. Nkem was very understanding and communicated with me well during my stay."
40,787745,2020-02-29,Amazing place! Really clean and easy to get to. Communication was amazing and quick. They provide you everything you need to know in detail from how to access the place to check in /out info. My partner and I had a really great stay would definitely book again if needed!

45,160642,2019-03-10,"Grace è una persona molto riservata ma disponibile, la sua casa è super pulita e comoda.<br/>Vicina ai mezzi, un autobus M2 sotto casa e le metropolitane a circa 200 metri 2-3 espresso - B e C.<br/>Il quartiere è tranquillo e a 5 minuti da Central Park North.<br/>Consigliatissimo"

49,852557,2021-10-16,comunicarse con el sr lázaro o la sra muy buenos anfitriones .. recomendado
50,704149,2021-08-16,I had a wonderful experience with this stay. Both of the hosts were friendly and accommodating. The room and apartment were extremely clean and tidy. Had nice amenities like a mini fridge and TV in bedroom. For me it was super convenient being just a few blocks from L train which goes right to Williamsburg Brooklyn and Union Square Manhattan. There is also a burgeoning nightlife out in that part of Ridgewood which wasn’t there when I was living there 10 years ago. Would highly recommended!
51,713423,2021-03-21,A place to stay where you<br/>Feels like home.
52,6400,2019-11-02,"The building is really interesting, such a cool experience if you wanna try something not common... I would say it is only for artistic people cause the vibe is not for everyone. The place is far from sparkling clean and there’s many tenants but everyone is respectful."
53,750706,2020-11-27,Very comfy space and easy check in process <br/>I Was able to use this a space as a little get away to have small thanks giving  dinner with my daughter and her mom<br/>And they both loved the space as well

55,716402,2020-08-01,Beautiful place and there is enough space. The kitchen and backyard were absolutely gorgeous.
56,185793,2021-07-13,"Great location just a short walk to the C train, this was the perfect location to explore Brooklyn and Manhattan."
57,256764,2019-01-04,Nice location very clean and comfy
58,352547,2019-03-23,"El departamento tiene una ubicación excelente, muy accesible para viajar a cualquier parte de NY e incluso a New Jersey.<br/>Es muy confortable.<br/>Niket fue muy atento y siempre estuvo dispuesto a darnos recomendaciones para disfrutar de NY"
59,830925,2021-07-29,"This is super great place to stay. Communication is smooth, check-in is easy, you always have a person at front desk of the building so that you can feel safe, a minute to subway, seconds to battery park, place is clean, the description about room is accurate. You will not feel any frustration at all."
60,193595,2019-04-06,"100% recommend this home for any traveler or call their home base. Stayed in Brooklyn for my very cold spring break and the house was warm with an added space heater provided but we rarely needed it. Shower was 10/10, very nice decor throughout the house and a comfortable bed. Room was spacious too ! The hosts Bill and Oates were so accommodating and positive and made a lasting impression on the trip."
61,83209,2019-06-14,"Dee’s apartment is perfectly situated in a village atmosphere just off Broadway, barely five minutes walk from the Hudson River and in the other direction to Central Park. I only met Dee on the last evening I was there but she’d left everything perfectly prepared with key access Wi-Fi and all the facilities you’ll need for a perfect stay. I’d recommend it to anybody! Hurry before the time slo"
62,654343,2021-05-25,This place is great! Pictures are very accurate and the place is super close to the subway! I wasn’t able to take advantage of the outdoor patio (they were doing some construction in back) but once it’s finished you can tell it’ll be a great space to enjoy on a cool night! Amy was very good at communicating. Would for sure stay here again!
63,168045,2021-06-30,"Great value for the space and location -- really it cannot be beat! Communication and check in could not have been better and I so appreciated that while traveling solo with my two young kids. <br/>I was a little weary when I read on the listing that smoking in the apartment is allowed -- and you can tell. I wouldn't say it was a heavy smell, but every time we came in the smell immediately struck me. I got used to it after a few minutes and it didn't linger on our belongings after leaving from our two day stay, but it's something to be aware of. <br/>Plenty of space and comfortable and all as advertised."
64,800885,2021-09-19,"It was a good place to stay. Had a few issues, but Dino was very responsive."
65,667575,2019-05-04,"I was very impressed with the apt. The pictures did not do it justice. Carlton was a wonderful host. When I inquired about anything, he responded immediately.  I was even lost one day and he helped me find my way back. As a woman traveling alone, I felt very safe coming and going to the place. I recommend everyone travelling to New York to stay here!! I wish I could give Carlton many more stars!! He made my stay very comfortable, pleasant and extremely safe!! Thank you so much!!"
66,338676,2021-10-01,"Great location, clean, safe and easy check-in, management on-site, great rooftop, convenient new washer/dryers installed while we were there.  Only complaint is that the wall heat/ac units are loud, hard to sleep with them on."
67,614899,2019-05-09,"Great property, very clean and nice to stay at. We had a private bathroom to our room, which was excellent. Breakfast in the morning, and Win had tips for how we could get to the NYC center faster by car: very thoughtful! Really nice hosts too!<br/><br/>Only minor downside could be that it's a bit full with cars in the street, so do prepare to search a little in the street if you're by car.<br/><br/>I recommend staying here! Great value!"
68,783570,2019-12-09,"Ottima location per visitare New York, pulizia e accoglienza impeccabile, consigliato!"
69,417333,2019-03-05,"Would highly recommend this apartment. <br/>Clean, great shower and all the necessities needed. <br/>About a 20-30 min trip to downtown Manhattan (including getting to the subway from apartment). <br/>Clear instructions given from host & quick communication."
70,48905,2019-03-17,The host canceled this reservation 28 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
71,850020,2021-09-11,"Alice’s place was spacious, modern, beautiful, and cozy.  The walkability of the apt is off the charts, it’s close to literally everything you could want to do and very close to the train station.  I would definitely stay again when in the area!"
72,822592,2021-05-24,"This place was great. The apartment was clean, the sheets and towels were washed, and the kitchen was ready to be used. A few things that made us feel at home were: the nice selection of complimentary coffee and tea, hand lotion, hand and dishwashing soaps, the temperature control unit, and disinfectant wipes. There’s a small backyard that I didn’t utilize but I’m sure it would have been very nice to hangout in. This place is also very close to a subway station, so public transit was easily accessible. <br/><br/>One thing to remember is it’s really hard to see the address on the building at night. So if you arrive after dark like we did, you’ll have a hard time finding the right house the first time until you get more familiar with the location.<br/><br/>The neighborhood is made up of two story houses that have a separate apartment in the basement. This unit is a basement apartment, so the stairs leading to the apartment’s front door are located underneath the main building’s porch. The stairs leading down to the front door are narrow and a little steep, so keep that in mind if you’re a disabled guest like I am. <br/><br/>Overall, it was a nice place to stay and Jonathan responded to my messages very quickly. I would recommend this place. Thank you, Jonathan!"
73,498098,2019-02-17,This place is great. Clean and very quiet. Great food near by.
74,657855,2020-01-01,"The room was great, with a good view of the neighborhood, beautiful decorations, and plenty of space to settle into."
75,649165,2019-01-21,This place is stylish and clean. I have lived in many places and found the beddings and couches here are the cleanest. The whole apartment is recently renovated. The host Sam is very nice and helpful. I had a nice stay for the first week of my new job. I  recommend this place.
76,695351,2019-11-11,环境温馨，大部分家电都是新的，房子节省空间的设计很棒，厕所有点拥挤，超过180cm的朋友就不推荐了。整体4
77,656799,2020-01-19,Terrence and Teresa are incredibly friendly and welcoming. They had a ton of helpful tips for things to do around them. Their spot is close to public transit and we had no issue getting around. I definitely recommend staying here.
78,692622,2021-10-14,Great apartment and a great host! Very communicative and overall a smooth experience!
79,294508,2020-11-11,Perfect
80,776249,2020-05-02,You get what you pay for. Good communication. Morning cleaning would help.
81,679872,2019-03-30,"Ellen's place was perfect for my needs.  I was traveling alone, in Brooklyn overnight for work.  It's small, but had everything I could possibly need.  It was clean and super comfortable and in a great neighborhood. I would definitely stay there again next time!"
82,354167,2019-02-24,"Great little studio space, perfect for a solo traveler. Location is amazing and it’s an amazing value for NYC! Highly recommend!"

85,487879,2019-10-27,Seeranie's place was easy to find and a short 10 minute walk from both Jamaica-Van Wyck and Sutphin-JFK subway station. Check in was a breeze and I always felt as if I had the place to myself. Great value for the price.
86,165369,2019-08-25,"Soon's place was just what we needed for a short trip to the big city! His space was very clean and comfortable. Soon was so great to talk to, even made me a nice cup of espresso the day we arrived! He offered some great local tips! Even recommended a few places to visit that I was already planning on going to which was a great reassurance. The location was good and just a short few blocks from the 2 and 3 train that will take you directly to Manhattan.  Overall, it was a great deal and a great space and a top competitor for the next time we visit NYC. Thanks Soon!"
87,793740,2020-04-30,"Abdul is a truly amazing host and definitely goes the extra mile to make sure that his guests feel comfortable and welcome. His place is situated in a perfect part of Astoria. 2 blocks and you are on 30th Ave and have a choice of whatever you want to eat, drink or shop for.  Again kudos to the host Abdul. My hat is off to you sir and thank you for being such a pleasant and gracious host."
88,850418,2021-11-14,"The condo was perfect for my bf and I! It's located in the most convenient area. There's building security, food places right outside, steps from the subway and around the corner from the LIRR. <br/><br/>The condo was clean and exactly as pictured in the listing. Check-in and check-out was super easy. John's communication was on point. He was quick to respond to our questions during our stay. We needed an early check-in and he made sure the place was ready for us. He even put together a food guide! Also, the mattress is so comfortable, I slept like a rock on it every night!<br/><br/>I definitely will be staying again the next time the bf visits! Thank you again John!"
89,597019,2019-03-27,Great place to stay and close to all we needed! Clean and exactly as described!

91,874513,2021-09-25,Really wonderful Airbnb! Sheryl-Ann is a phenomenal host.
92,593585,2019-10-16,"Christopher's place is nice, spacious and comfortable, especially the kitchen. The bed is not a queen size bed, which makes it pretty uncomfortable to sleep with two people. The amenities are great and I love how the place is being decorated. The host is friendly and helpful too. Overall, we enjoyed our stay! :)"
93,700720,2020-11-02,"NICE SUPER HOST!!! Great home, great neighborhood even their son was a cool person!! Would recommend this place 100 times over!!"
94,781863,2021-06-09,This place doesn't like what shown in the advertisement. I made the booking one day prior to check-in and then I asked to cancel the reservation.  Firstly the host agrees to cancel and then after says according to the cancellation policy cannot refund the money. How unfair the things like this. I made inquire this to Airbnb team but they didn't give any answer to me as well.
95,649592,2019-01-02,"I had the chance to stay in Shachi's apartment for a year-end trip in New York. I love how clean and stylish it was, and to me, the best value came from its location - just a few blocks from the Graham station. - We were a party of 4,  and we were able to accommodate in Shachi's apartment without trouble. <br/><br/>In addition to the place, I want to highlight how attentive Shachi was to meet my late check-in and early check-out times. I totally recommend this place if it ever gets available again. Shachi is a great host, and her place helped me build good experience in New York and with Airbnb!"
96,692640,2019-07-05,"Small, but good location and value for money. Kitchen could do with a clean."
97,678822,2019-08-05,"He was so kind, helpful and friendly. And the house was so cozy and clean. I strongly recommend this place :-)"
98,486250,2019-12-23,"Thank you once again for chance to stay in your apartment! Had a last minute travel and appointment, Rose was super helpful in setting up everything swiftly! Awesome location, very cozy and clean apartment, good taste of style. Very easy to get around especially when its so cold outside.<br/>Would definitely recommend/book again.<br/>Thanks for the hospitality."
99,168893,2019-03-10,This place was in a wonderful location for my museum visits! I took beautiful walks along Central Park to my destination: the Guggenheim. This is a stylish place for one or a couple! Recommend!
100,489420,2019-11-08,My family and I had a wonderful experience with this place.  Was convenient to the subway and Central Park.

Thank you !"
104,262228,2019-04-29,"Attendez vous à passer un séjour mémorable chez Svetlana ! elle nous a réservé un bon accueil avec quelques attentions et tout était confortable. Belle chambre. Son appartement est très propre, pas de perte de temps car proche de Manhattan (la vue avec le tramway est super!). elle nous a laissé un emplacement dans son frigo pour notre petit déjeuner.<br/>Elle nous a fait beaucoup de suggestions pratiques pour nos déplacements et choses à voir. Très bonne expérience à renouveler. Merci Svetlana"
105,496102,2019-09-09,"The location of this apartment is terrific; it's close to lots of restaurants and has easy access to the subway system.  In addition, it's very quiet and has a very pleasant view from the bedroom windows out onto a backyard area.  However, it has a really tiny shower, lacks a suitable laptop workspace (or much table space at all), and does not really have sufficient storage space for more than one guest."
106,488736,2019-09-14,Mich was a nice host who was in the appartment when we arrived. Everything was exactly how it was described. We can only recommend this Airbnb! Good connection with subway.
107,494809,2019-12-05,"Mercedes is very warm, entertaining and is always available to help. She was really kind, told me to take whatever I needed in the kitchen. <br/>Her place is exactly as shown in the pictures and is close to two train stations. There are many grocery stores and eateries nearby that are just walking distance if you'd like to buy things to cook, order food or eat out. <br/>It was my first and a great experience in New York. Thanks again, Mercedes."

Chris’ house is cozy and inviting and we felt very welcome and at home. It’s rare to find a place in the city with two and a half baths and those really came in handy for our group of four family members traveling together. Great communication. Overall, we had a great stay at Chris’ house and I highly recommend it for travelers who want an inviting, interesting, and comfortable space to spend time in between city adventures!"

141,718500,2021-06-16,Hidden gem! Don’t let the area fool you. The neighbors were extremely welcoming when we arrived. There were plenty appliances and cookware for us to use. The living space was larger than expected with a beautiful and surprisingly spacious backyard. The sub station is also a few blocks down from the location which is extremely convenient. Would recommend for those who are on a budget and wants to experience all parts of New York!
142,334422,2020-02-26,"Location location location! Not even a block to Central Park, great restaurants and grocery stores.

144,398015,2019-11-04,"Very close to trains. Room was as expected. Cold but there's a space heater in the room. Only issue was the typical Air BnB issue, hair everywhere. Hair in the shower, on the bathroom floor, the sink and the toilet had been wiped b/c the seat was up but when I put it down, hair on the toilet seat. I guess the cleaning rag had hair on it. Aside from that, location is great."

148,769744,2021-05-22,"Great neighborhood, private entrance. Spacious, but troublesome for tall people-- anyone over 6' will hit their head on lights and ceiling beams constantly, as I did."
149,798418,2020-02-23,Great proximity to amenities in the area. Stayed for an Avant Gardner show and worked out great.

156,678049,2020-12-31,"If you’re looking for a homey Airbnb in a terrific Brooklyn location, this is the place.  My husband and I came to Brooklyn to spend time at the birth of our first grandchild.  The plan was that I would then spend 3 weeks alone as I can work remotely. When we arrived, our hosts were as welcoming as one can be in a pandemic wearing masks and Jean had thoughtfully left a book out by Anna Quindlen called NANAVILLE, about her experience as a grandmother. Our Airbnb was on the second floor and our comings and goings were quite private. In fact, Jean and Aric respected our privacy completely yet were warm and friendly and made themselves thoroughly accessible when there was a question or a need. Their Airbnb manual was thorough and up to date, especially regarding where to find services in the city.  The bathroom has a lovely shower. The kitchen is small but quite well equipped. The only thing I missed was a microwave, because I like to reheat my coffee constantly throughout the workday. The flatscreen TV allowed access to all the streaming services I have at home and finally, the WiFi was excellent."
157,709250,2019-06-01,"My room was clean and fully furnished with modern Ikea furniture and stylish bedding ready to go upon my arrival. The host Mori who is an angel was very friendly and gave me a full tour of the building and the apartment. Upon greeting me she quickly explained the building rules and apt rules, trash days etc. She then walked me outside and told me about the neighborhood, being very specific on how to catch each train and where it would take me. She offered to get in touch with her if I ever locked myself out and explained there will be a $40 charge if she was far away and had to Uber back to help me (which I did unfortunately lock myself out on two occasions :/ but she saved my life and let me back in the building and didn't charge me). I really enjoyed my stay there and meeting everyone, and even though I had some complications with two of the residents there.. one during my stay, and the other after I moved out. They both talked to me and apologized and made things right again, so my review is an honest 5 star review and I will recommend this place to anyone who's looking for a private, relaxing stay in NYC, surrounded great food, shopping malls within walking distance, and easy commute by bus or train to anywhere in the city within 1 block distance. Thank you Haru, Hiro and Mori for all your help."
158,858308,2021-11-27,"I’m a Brooklyn native and was visiting home for the holidays. Juniors place was great! He was very accommodating and quick with communications. Next time I’m visiting home, I hope to stay with Junior again!"

I especially enjoyed meeting Miho and getting a chance to get to know her over some food and tea. As a former New Yorker, trust me when I say this is a real gem of a stay! I hope to be back someday. Thanks Miho!"
162,822913,2021-03-20,Best place ever booked. Privacy is there and quiet neighborhood. Always a pleasure staying over.
163,512016,2019-04-29,"Great place! A bit funky indeed, but so charming and a warm welcome after a day full of impressions. In the middle of Greenwich, the Village - the best of neighbourhoods to stay in NYC to our knowledge ... which isn’t based on a thorough investigation of all of NYC, of course! We just had such a good time there with our teenage daughters. We feel grateful for having spent a week there."

166,116351,2019-10-30,"Negatives: Upon entering, there was the smell of dead rodents - it dissipated after a day or two. There were frequent small cockroaches in the bedroom and the bathroom. There was a cigarette under the bed when I got there. Cobwebs in the stairwell. (The kitchen was very clean however!) The bedroom I rented was freezing at night. Positives: The other Airbnb travelers were very sweet and accommodating and sociable. There are spaces for each roomie to store their own groceries and toiletries."

175,619292,2019-05-24,"We have spent 6 nights at James place for the graduation of our daughter from NYU. We have enjoyed the place and the stay. The location was perfect for us, steps away from NYU, Washington Square, West Village and SOHO. Several underground stations, restaurants and shops are minutes away. The place is very clean, very calm, very spacious, very beautifully decorated with artworks and a lot of taste. The flat is fully equipped with all amenities (dishwasher, washing machine, dryer, irons, hair dryers...). James is a very nice host, easily reachable by phone and very helpful.<br/>Few points to be noted: No black-out curtains or shutters (it was fine with sleeping masks); Flat is located 1.5 floors above street level without elevator (it was not easy with our heavy luggages). Also Air Conditioning was not working fine (probably needs small seasonal maintenance).<br/>We highly recommend the place :))"

177,607582,2019-08-18,La hospitalidad de Jake es increíble. Muy amable y dispuesto a ayudarte en lo que necesites. Muy detallista. Hemos estado muy a gusto en casa de Jake.
178,673195,2021-05-23,Spacious first floor apartment of a 2 family home. It served exactly the purpose we needed which was space to stay in while visiting family on the island from which we could also work. Wifi allowed us to do the work we needed to do. I found the bed extremely comfortable while my husband would of preferred a queen with better linens. It really was cozy. He said he was awake from noise in the neighborhood one night but I think it was just the excitement of the start of warm weather weekend. I would absolutely stay here again and do recommend it to anyone who wants to feel like they are in a home away from home.
179,698768,2019-11-17,Terrific place with attention to detail.  Super clean and comfy bed!  Highly recommend.

185,464613,2021-10-11,"Appartamento situato a pochi isolati dalla metro, ottimo per potersi recare a Manhattan (circa 50’ di metro). La casa era pulita e completa di tutti i confort necessari. A pochi metri c’è il parco divertimenti di cony island e molti piccoli negozi per comprare cibo anche d’asporto. Parcheggio gratuito in strada"
186,73614,2019-02-18,"The Box House Hotel is a stylish hotel with charming decoration and attentive staff. My only problem is that this is definitely a hotel and not an AirBnB. Everything was very clean, and the Duplex room is super cool and spacious.  It is not super convienient if you need to travel into the city. There are a lot of great resturants around, and a couple mid-size grocery stores. Overalll, I recommed Box House and would stay again if I was going to be in Brooklyn."
187,436247,2019-12-03,"Excellent studio apartment. Quiet. Clean. Close to coffee shops, restaurants and the subway. Second time staying there. Plan another stay next trip."

196,130251,2021-11-08,Fantastic!
197,680704,2019-05-09,"Fantastic spot in the West Village. As someone that has stayed in New York at many hotels as a business traveler, I found the place to be reminiscent of what an artist’s or writer’s studio could look like. The bathroom has a great shower and the bed was comfortable. The host was helpful and responsive. I will likely stay here again when I am in NYC. Strongly recommended!"
198,145214,2019-06-12,"Jake is a kind, attentive, thoughtful and responsive host. He seems to genuinely enjoy meeting the needs of his guests and does it very well. We had everything that we needed in our top floor apartment. We only wish that we had been there longer to read some of Jake's extensive literary collection. The place exceeded all our airbnb requirements: clean, safe, quiet, comfortable, charming, good location, reasonably priced, lots of space, privacy but easy to reach our host. We look forward to staying at Jake's place in a lovely part of Brooklyn soon."
199,539063,2020-03-01,Very Cozy and Central

201,749467,2021-05-31,I have stayed with Angelica multiple times  and it has always been a great experience. The suite is as described and perfect for a couple or solo traveller. Angelica is an excellent host and the communication is always efficient. The location is ideal with easy access to the L and M trains. I look forward to staying again and definitely recommend either of her suites for a visit to NYC.
202,867918,2021-10-04,"Loved staying at Melissa’s place! I stayed here for a month. The bedroom is pretty good sized, especially considering it’s in Manhattan. I got really great direct sunlight and the room was bright for most hours of the day. The Airbnb was clean upon arrival and it was easy to communicate with Melissa! <br/><br/>If you’re visiting from outside of NYC, Melissa’s place is on a decently busy street and so there’s a lot of street noise! It took me a few days to get used to the sirens and cars honking, but this is a common thing in nyc. <br/><br/>The kitchen was a bit dirty at times, and I did find a cockroach in the bathroom one time, but my experience overall was good! (Lots of nice restaurants and cafes nearby!)"
203,316968,2020-01-02,"A perfect stay for my wife and me. It felt to us like we were coming home at night. If we should ever come back to Manhattan, we will definitely look for this apartment first."
204,889958,2021-10-23,Very close convenient to the Park and the heart of Astoria!
205,844697,2021-07-30,"If you’re gay and want to be close to all the bars in HK and enjoy an authentic loft, this spot is perfect for you. Obviously if you’re straight too lol but I mean you walk outside the front door the gay bars start next door and continue down the street. The space has high ceilings, a window unit ac that kept it cool July 30 with temps outside in the 90s. The only thing to be aware of is that the stairs from the front door to the apartment are quite narrow. I’m 6’2” 220 lbs and needed to turn sideways with my luggage to get up the stairs. I would just advise not to have oversized luggage and you’ll be fine. The street is blocked off for residents/restaurants so it is very quiet/walkable. The unit faces the rear so large windows overlook the back terrace/courtyards of the adjoining units. Would definitely stay here again."
206,292510,2019-04-12,"Josh and Chris were awesome hosts. They are both very kind, welcoming, and accommodating. I had never shared a place through Airbnb before and they made me feel very comfortable and really at home — I was sad to leave. <br/><br/>The space was clean, comfortable, and private. The location is about a 15 minute walk to and from all the decent spots in Williamsburg. I would definitely stay again without a question. Thanks so much for everything!"

208,853103,2021-06-15,"My wife (and 2 small dogs) and I were delighted to explore Brooklyn with Raymond’s house as our home base. Communication was proactive and clear, checkin and checkout were super smooth, and the place was spotless!"
209,848949,2021-09-27,"Great value, Gloria is very correspondent and accommodating. A great place if you need to bring a car!"
210,263435,2020-08-31,Great area and nice place for a couples weekend. If you have the chance stop by Saraghina Bakery and Restaurant. Went once for breakfast and once for dinner and was impressed with every single food we got - only a few blocks from the apartment.
211,200637,2019-02-19,"The apartment was really cute! Comfy bed, nice shower, very stylish. Would stay again."
212,343460,2019-12-08,"Perfect location to discover Manhattan & Brooklyn!<br/><br/>This location is perfect when you are traveling alone to New York. It is situated in a safe and quiet location, close to the subway line that will take you directly to Time Square.<br/><br/>The hosts James & Mina are really friendly. I mostly spoke with James, who welcomed me and made me feel right at home. <br/><br/>The room was big, bed was comfortable and bathroom had warm water and soft towels. <br/><br/>Definitely an ideal place to stay while discovering New York!"
213,795191,2019-12-14,"A super special place! You can tell that a homeowner furnished this spot, as it’s a beautifully appointed apartment. Quiet bedroom and great mattress; the bathroom and kitchen were on the smaller side, but absolutely perfect for two travelers (and we’ll stocked). We loved the neighborhood too— adorable cafes and hole-in-the-wall art galleries. We’ll be back!"
214,884685,2021-09-22,This place is clean and the host is quite responsive and helpful.
215,865646,2021-11-26,It was great  I loved the view

217,871127,2021-07-11,"Kind and responsive host throughout. The apartment in general is very spacious, and located in the heart of Williamsburg, with a view of Manhattan at the doorstep. Room was very clean and designed with boutique hotel style, comfortable bed, central AC, and your own door to the patio area. Couldn’t have asked for more."
218,772600,2021-11-23,"Overall the place was amazing, the rooms are great sizes! I love he communicates if you have a problem. The bathroom did end up having little baby bugs around the toilet. I loved either having heat or just air in the apartment, i also loved the codes and everything"
219,746132,2021-06-15,Very clean and comfortable.
220,875547,2021-11-22,"The place was great— there is a sink in the room which is pretty convenient. Since we were there for only a night, it was perfect because it was so close to places like Times Square and Korea Town."
221,594013,2019-06-30,"Alistair’s place was amazing and incredibly well located for easy commuting around NYC. There are amazing restaurants within a few minutes walking distance, lots of coffee shops, and the subway stop on Broadway is super close by. I would definitely stay at Alistair’s place again."
222,765060,2019-10-27,Nice
223,753855,2019-07-14,"Hoda's place was great! A beautiful apartment with nice views, and the locationwas perfect to be able to walk to central park, any where midtown, or close to the subway. We would definitely return."
224,620372,2019-01-28,"My friend and I booked a last minute trip to NY from Charleston, SC. Ting was very helpful with booking and also very quick with responding to any questions we had. She allowed us to check in early, which was great. The location of the apartment is convenient to the J train, and also within walking distance to a lot of stores nearby. The place was super clean, which was very comforting because I am super OCD when it comes to cleanliness. The area was relatively quiet outside, Saturday night there was a lot of noise within the neighborhood but nothing too crazy. However, we were woken up early every morning during our stay by the tenants upstairs, we could hear every footstep and pin drop they made which was unfortunate on the days we wanted to sleep in. The showers were only hot for a few minutes, but I’m assuming this is because of so many other people within the complex and it also be freezing outside. It wasn’t too much of an issue, but definitely not ideal. Other than those things, we very much enjoyed our stay and would definitely recommend/stay here again in the future. Thank you!"
225,602050,2019-05-20,"We had a great time, we will recomend for sure!"
226,794400,2019-12-31,"Malaika’s apartment is located in a very nice family neighborhood with close access to subways and groceries, the place was clean and homely, it was perfect for us.. I highly recommend this rental."

229,675778,2021-11-29,"We enjoyed our stay here, it’s right in the middle of everything on SoHo and the west village. The apartment is a third floor walk up and the building is a bit dingy, but the unit itself was clean and spacious. There are sheets, towels, shampoo, cups and plates to use.  We most of all appreciated Pietro’s responsive  communication, flexibility and graciousness."
230,578861,2021-04-23,"Jay's place was great! Nice studio apartment on the third floor with all the basic amenities you'd expect. It's actually really cool what he's done with the space. Pull out couch was perfect for a movie night-in. Jay was great and super communicative. Met us there when we arrived, showed us the space, all that. Check-out was easy and no-stress. I'd definitely stay here again."
231,120392,2019-10-21,"The place is just as it is in the pictures. It's clean and everything you need for a citytrip. <br/>For some people the mattress might be a bit on the hard side, but it didn't bother me at all and I had a good night sleep.<br/>I also liked the fact the house was silent from 11pm to 7am, allowing me to have a peaceful night and get some rest.<br/>The bathroom and room were clean, wifi was good and checking in/out was easy. Overall I enjoyed my stay and definitely recommend it.<br/><br/>The neighborhood was, for NYC terms, quiet and it's also safe to walk later in the evening. The subway is a 5 to 10 minute walk and will take you straight to the middle of Manhattan."
232,857692,2021-06-07,"If you want a great place to stay, Stephanie's place is it. When we walked in all we could say was ""WOW""! Everything looked new and clean. The rooms were so nice. All the amenities, starting with the washer and dryer, were perfect. This definitely made us feel like home. This place was better than some of the top of the line hotels we have stayed in. It is the best Airbnb  we have stayed in so far when coming to New York, and we will try to book it every time we come.  Dexton and Carline"
233,659604,2019-11-21,The host canceled this reservation 14 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
234,618883,2020-01-04,Jade's place is an amazing location to experience the city. its nice to end a busy day at her place. She is very friendly and interested in what you want to do on your day. Thanks to her we had some amazing brunch moments!
235,764149,2019-12-02,"The room is as described, very lovely. Would have loved if the entire apartment matched the photos. It might not be my place to say this, but I must: clean the common areas of you intend for guests to be free to use them. <br/><br/>If your looking for a place to crash and stay only for sleeping, this is great! If you want to cook, check in with Mo first to make sure you have the proper utensils and thangs."
236,856168,2021-08-29,"Great location to the Brooklyn Mirage if you are seeing a show there! Easy check in, very clean and felt safe. I would stay there again."

240,863348,2021-05-06,Amazing stay! So worth it !
241,823530,2020-09-07,"BEWARE ! This place is basically a shelter ,you can tell by the people there AND there was literally a crackpipe in the cabinet of room , a full blown flood happened in our room and our host Anna couldn’t have cared less ,luckily Jaden ( I said Julian before but his name is Jaden )helped us out greatly! The building looks halfway decent in broad daylight BUT AT NIGHT is an entirely different story , you should definitely stay inside . Oh and they claim to have a doorman but he’s actually a security guard .....but if you don’t care about any of these things then you should be fine "
242,693231,2019-09-26,Cute apartment. Thanks for the local tips also!
243,829265,2021-04-25,"Clean, bright, and airy, Miso's place was wonderful.  It is ideally situated in the bustling neighborhood of Bushwick; central to just about everywhere I needed to go.  The check-in process was a breeze and keyless entry was a stress reliever."
244,891678,2021-11-14,"5/5 - wished there was a higher scale! This apartment is amazing and the hosts are service minded to say the least! <br/><br/>We were five people staying in the apartment and it suited us really well. The location is as central as one can get, neighborhood is nice, and the newly renovated apartment had all the necessities one could wish for. Everything is very fresh and classy. <br/><br/>John & Kerri has been the most amazing hosts as well. We got load of suggestions and all our questions answered within a short timeframe. If something was unclear or we needed to ask - everything was provided ASAP from the host. <br/><br/>All and all - a great apartment with great hosts! Would for sure check availability if we’re going back some day. You won’t be disappointed as a renter of this unit!"
245,413515,2021-07-01,Great host! Addressed any issues we had and was very accommodating
246,845468,2021-02-16,This place was in a great beautiful area close to everything. I had such a great time staying here. Finding parking at night was a little tricky but of course that’s everywhere in NY. Will definitely be back!
247,815255,2021-07-01,Great apartment in an awesome location (alphabet city is the best) and very spacious for the price! Mario was very communicative and super helpful when I had to adjust my schedule! Highly recommend.
248,863347,2021-05-03,"Awesome room, so confy bed and bedding, nice amenities in the room. You have your privacy at all times, and you can come and go as you please. <br/>Quiet house and quiet building. The street can be a bit noisy for moments but the overall experience was really nice. The rooftop is also awesome, you can go up there to sit and relax for a while if you feel like it."
249,816503,2020-10-23,Excellent airbnb!!!
250,792066,2021-05-13,"AMAZING! Great location, friendliest air b&b host I have ever had!! Came to NYC with no one and left with an amazing friend. Moying was so helpful and hospitable. Gave me cookies, a towel, great conversations, and we even got noodles together! Would absolutely stay again, I loved it!! Her place is on the fifth floor so be prepared for stairs! So worth every step though! Although the place is small, Moying was able to provide amazing privacy! <br/><br/>Can’t say enough good things! Highly recommend. :)"
251,668558,2019-09-16,"The room is just perfect, with all the carefully selected details. Sharing a kitchen and a bathroom was not an issue. We really felt like at home.<br/>Jon was a perfect host - very helpful, answered all our messages immediately.<br/>Thank you!"
252,856318,2021-05-19,"You will feel right at home... if you have OCD like my self, you will feel very comfortable with how clean this place is. Devon is there to answer any questions no matter what time of day it is. My daughter and I had a wonderful and comfortable stay. Not mention they have every kind of TV app  you want Hulu, Netflix, Prime, etc that’s important if you need to catch up on some shows in your down time"
253,212296,2019-06-22,"Nathan’s appartment is very nice, great host, super clean, located near subway in beautiful Harlem. Their dog, Bear, likes to play, is amazingly cute and is very well educated!"
254,696943,2021-11-03,"Great location! Simple set up, but perfect for what we needed. Walking distance to great bars and restaurants, right down the block from a subway stop too."
255,780468,2021-06-11,"This was a great space! Loved being in the heart of Brooklyn :) There are 3 other rooms available to stay in at the house and 2 bathrooms total. Alex is very quick to respond and answered any questions we had as well as accommodate any request we made. The common areas were great and had a wide range of coffee and teas for us to enjoy. Plates, pots, pans etc where very accessible as well. Walls are thin and sometimes there were dishes in the sink but other than that it was clean. Since animals are allowed to stay there was pet fur but it was so fun seeing some of the puppers that stayed and were so lovey  takes around an hour to get into Manhattan on the 2/5 lines. It's an authentic Brooklyn experience with Bodegas at every corner and vendors accessible for souvenirs. Parking was alright. We kept our truck in the Target lot, 8 min walk, so we wouldn't have to feed the meter/ worry about street cleaners during the week and it was pretty affordable. Plus we could get groceries and anything extra we needed at Target. Great space, decent location, awesome host :)"
256,295780,2020-12-18,Nadir’s place is the best location in Astoria—15 minutes by N/W train to Manhattan & tons of cafes/restaurants nearby. It is very clean & Nadir is very helpful to guests. Probably the best place I’ve stayed at in NYC.
257,823903,2021-09-18,Amazing Home In Brooklyn! Next to a lot of bars and restaurants.
258,616140,2019-07-15,"This garden apartment is on a shady quiet street in an excellent location in Park Slope.  It is convenient to nearly anything you could want and the detailed information Bruce gives his guests is available both online and in print inside the apartment.  The queen-sized bed is comfortable, however quite low to the ground which might be a problem for some people.  The air conditioning (in July) worked very well and provided our ""white noise"" during the night, although could be extra loud at times when cycling on and off. The biggest negative is the strong musty smell upon entering the apartment and particularly in the bathroom which someone with sensitivities may wish to be aware of before booking."
259,90221,2019-12-01,"This place is a hidden gem — central to many of the places you want to be in Greenwich village while also feeling like a quiet, secluded space just a little off the beaten path. And the host, Andrew, is very helpful and communicative. Highly recommend!"
260,763657,2020-03-08,"Great hospitality quick response,easy and fast check in and the place was clean as and cozy.when ever I'm visiting newyork again they will be first to check for availability."

262,841315,2021-05-31,"Awesome communication and really prime location in the LES. A lot of great restaurants and cocktail bars in walking distance. Free street parking just make sure to check signs, you might have to move your car at least once if you stay over the weekend. Katie’s place was clean and had everything we needed for our stay!"
263,673104,2019-04-02,"Laura’s place is great. Quite, clean and cozy. You’ll feel at home. <br/>Our only small issue was that in the apt was a little bit cold, but there are heaters and we are also warm Italian people - probably this is not a problem for a lot of other people. <br/>Everything else was perfect."
264,844047,2021-09-19,"solid place, no issues, served our purpose for a low key reasonably priced stay in Brooklyn."
265,723120,2020-01-11,Great place to stay if you find yourself in Brooklyn!
266,764153,2021-05-23,My sister and I traveled for our mother’s memorial. Terrell was aware and upon arrival we were greeted with roses and a card. The place is exactly like the pictures and very clean. She responds quickly so the communication was amazing. I will definitely be staying here again!
267,96283,2019-09-13,"Livia was a wonderful host for my first Airbnb stay. Communication and check-in was easy and she gave me some tips on where to go in the city. <br/><br/>Great location, if you don't mind being a little bit out of the city. I liked that the street is nice and quite at night. The commute to Manhattan is easy and available at all times of the day."
268,831715,2021-08-25,"Melekh es una persona muy preocupada, siempre envía mensajes para saber como estamos y ofrece su ayuda para cualquier cosa, le preguntamos si tenía una balanza que nos prestara para calcular el peso de nuestras maletas y en la tarde ya había comprado una para nosotros, nos facilitó colchas para la cama, paños desinfectantes, papel de cocina e higiénico, el lugar está muy cómodo para dormir, tiene aire acondicionado y un televisor para poder ver la tv, Melekh se preocupa mucho de la limpieza del lugar, si buscas un lugar para dormir y recorrer la ciudad durante el día deberías quedarte aquí!"

271,493661,2019-09-13,"Nice location, beautiful and clean house plus great hosts! Well... I'm not sure what else could someone need while living of visiting NY! I strongly recommend to stay at Fernando and Clara’s place."
272,672502,2019-03-30,One of my best experience on Airbnb! The place is super clean and ultra comfy. Lots of sun during the day. Great bed. And the neighbourhood is the best you can find in BK (lots of coffee shops and restaurants just minutes away from the hustle of Williamsburg).
273,885814,2021-09-19,"Amazing views and an incredible stay. Everyone was friendly, helpful and willing to assist in any way. The place is awesome, very clean and quiet. The pictures show you some of what to expect but you will see so much more once you actually arrive. I was able to stay with my small family with no issues and everyone loved the place along with location."
274,714317,2019-05-19,Brian is so nice and his apartment has a good location. It’s close to several metro stations.
275,190672,2019-04-22,Is not a entire house. You can only access the 2nd floor and the attics. Very dirty.
276,881644,2021-11-18,"This apt as well as the whole building was perfection. <br/>It’s more than I expected!<br/>Impeccably clean, all services (internet is the fastest you can find!) you have everything you need to feel comfortable and secure.<br/>The amenities in the building like the gym are premium quality.<br/>The location is also really good, you have the subway that connects you to the city and Brooklyn right around the corner. <br/>Kj was available at all times and she very kindly answer all my questions!<br/>I would DEFINITELY come back without hesitating."

287,698541,2019-08-26,Excellent space as described.  We enjoyed our stay in the Bronx!
288,774107,2021-07-18,"Bertha and her boyfriend were both very nice. The room is a gem. It’s a very busy and active neighborhood, so it’s pretty loud, but you’re six floors up, so it’s not so bad. Her air conditioner works great in the hot summer. Her ad says free street parking, which is very tricky in that neighborhood. You’re best bet is to park in the paid parking lot across the street, which is $10 for 12 hours; not bad at all for NYC. I don’t know what it is about her bed, but I slept very well despite being an insomniac. You have to share a bathroom with them, but I rarely saw them after I checked in so it wasn’t a problem. Overall, highly recommend."
289,197570,2020-10-16,"Not what I expected. Place was not clean, cabel did not work, wifi did not work, basic stuff like paper towels were not there, we have a pictures of mouse and roaches. I have documented everything."

292,309288,2019-04-09,"We had a very pleasant stay at Christopher's place. It is ideally located just next to Central Park, and has everything you need for a few days discovering the city. Chris is very welcoming and caring. We will definitely come back for our next trip to New York!"
293,399364,2019-07-04,"J is very welcoming and helpful, he makes our stay comfortable and convenient. Just maybe a bit noise on street sometimes in the morning, but it's not a big deal for me. I will choose there for next time visit."
294,796011,2021-08-02,Beautiful location beautiful appartment highly recomned for a quick visit!!
295,824161,2021-09-16,"Beautiful and unique home. You will feel right at home as soon as you walk in. Just bring your clothes and toiletries, everything else is there for you to use. King size bed,  large shower, jacuzzi tub and beautifully decorated. I have to mention the spiral staircase, it is narrow but since you really only have to use it twice a day, it was ok."
296,467192,2019-10-19,"Jeremy place is awesome place to stay in great area very convenient such as bus stop, grocery stores near by and also local coffee shops around. One thing I will suggest though is replace there window curtains because is translucent or put a blinds other that I will come back and stay here again."

299,760999,2019-10-06,I would definitely come back here again when I visit New York! Cute apartment  in a safe neighborhood! And just a few steps will take you to the Metro. Katherine and Nate are both very friendly and helpful. Oh... Most importantly the bedroom's got   a very comfy bed. I felt very well rested here :) Highly recommended!!!
300,845858,2021-10-08,"The house was exactly like the photo. It was really pretty.  Parking was a big issue we had to park a block and a half away because we couldn't park in the driveway and there wasn't really any available street parking. We wanted to watch television but unfortunately the t.v was in the living room and the camera was right above it. So we felt a little uncomfortable having a movie date night. The home was very clean and bathroom was very nice. The bed however in our room was not comfortable at all. it was very low and the mattress had plastic on it under the sheets which also contributed to us being hot. The room didn't have air condition so it was very hot due to it being a basement apartment. We didn't want to keep the door open while we slept although it was a tad bit cooler in the living room because their were other people there as well. There was only one towel and one wash cloth in the room but for 2 guest it should of been one for each of us. It would be great for them to put a stand in air condition and mount a small t.v on wall so people that have net-flex, Hulu, Disney plus and amazon could log into there accounts to watch movies. We had an issue with the wifi due to it not being the correct information for it on the listing. We eventually received the right one. Other than that the response time was great, she was very nice, place was clean and we might stay here again."
301,74789,2019-06-17,A comfortable room in a tastefully appointed home in a fun neighborhood. What more could you ask for? Recommended for anyone taking a trip to Brooklyn.
302,378723,2020-03-11,"This guy is really friendly and easy to talk to. I didn't expect to get into real conversations with my host, but I really enjoyed each one. The place was in a really cool location for someone new to the city with a subway/path station just two blocks away. Would recommend it to anyone!"
303,47858,2019-05-05,"Staying with J was perfect: 5 minute walk to the subway, 20 min walk to Central Park. Very quiet building, sparkling clean bathroom and bedroom, excellent communication. Couldn't have asked for a better host or location."
304,493685,2021-02-19,Clean and fresh
305,597842,2021-07-19,Julia is an amazing host! Quick to respond and help out. The place was super charming! The Schindler-esque bathroom looks just as good as it does in the pictures! Perfect locale for a Brooklyn getaway!
306,776110,2019-10-13,"I didn’t bring these issues up to the host while I was there but I didn’t have any other options when it came to relocating. The bedroom was fine, other than the paper thin wall to where I can hear the person next door snoring.. and I had to take the ac unit out because anytime someone was outside the window it woke me up so I had to close it. I walked into the bathroom one morning to find someone’s dirty underwear hanging on the shower.. I walked out the bathroom to get my phone and left the shower on so no one would go in so I could take a picture. I came back and they were gone. The bath was never clean and covered in public hairs and dirt from peoples shoes. I was showing my mom around the Airbnb on FaceTime and came into the kitchen and saw a roach crawling up the backsplash. I would’ve left that second but all hotels were completely booked. I know it’s not entirely fair because I didn’t bring these issues up to the host but I wasn’t comfortable in doing so and was just looking to leave and that point."
307,872770,2021-10-24,The room was great! It was as pictured. The place is very cute. It does great for the price. They have amenities like a coffee maker for use. A toothbrush if you forget one.

313,848599,2021-11-08,Harry’s place is in such a cute area! 145th st. subway is only a couple blocks away and gives you access to everything! We did have some issues with the iron door and the backyard door but Harry did what he could and resolved every issue! We even had a statue break while we were out in the bathroom causing almost a flood in the bathroom although we had to clean it Harry assisted how he could with fresh towels! Overall we felt safe and the place is quite spacious but don’t close the backyard door! Lol We learned the hard way! Thank you so much Harry for everything! You still owe us drinks!

353,891031,2021-11-09,"Amy’s loft space is perfect for a couple needing a place to catch some ZZZs after a day of exploring. Even though it’s a shared space, the room is private. It’s located in an awesome part of Brooklyn called Greenpoint which has a bunch of restaurants (Paulie Gee’s pizza and Bagel Point were some of our favorites; 10/10 would recommend) and bars/brewery (Brooklyn Brewery) nearby. The room is equipped with mini fridge and a microwave for your leftovers and even a air purifier to clean the air. Commuting from this area was very easy, the G Train is located off Greenpoint Ave and bus stop is right off Franklin St. Thank you again, Amy for the great hospitality and sharing your place with us!"

We had everything we needed as far as towels and bed linens, and it was really nice having a washer and dryer in the unit. The grocery store downstairs was also nice to have, very convenient! The location was a bit far from the center of town, but the public transportation was very close by. I would definitely recommend this place!"

371,652847,2021-09-04,"Super nice Airbnb and exactly as advertised on the website. The sheets and towels were neat and spotlessly clean. The bathroom also looked very clean. Overall a great experience, though only the only blemish is that the host charged us for a 1 inch-diameter blood stain that stained the bedsheet and the pad underneath."
372,819377,2021-09-29,Exactly what I was looking for. Very kind and considerate host. Thank you Deycke!
373,166241,2019-10-31,"A classic NYC studio apartment in an owner occupied building. In the back, overlooking a quiet interior courtyard. A few blocks access to a number of small grocery stores. Close to IRT lines to east and west side Manhattan. Very satisfactory. We enjoyed it a lot."
374,807638,2021-06-22,Never got back to me about check in and had to cancel the same morning.

378,294083,2019-05-18,"TRÈS BON SÉJOURS CHEZ HERMAN ! Un accueil des plus exceptionnels de mes voyages Airbnb. L'hôte est venu me chercher à l'aéroport et me ramener pour mon départ, une attention apprécié pour mon premier séjour au Etat-Unis. <br/>L'ensemble de la maison est propre, joliment agencé, c'est un espace agréable ou il fait bon vivre. Je me suis sentis comme à la maison. Le quartier résidentiel de Richmond Hill dans le Queens est sûr et reposant. Je travaille depuis internet; le grand bureau de la chambre m'était très pratique !  Depuis le logement compter 30 minutes de voiture ou 1 heure de Metro pour rejoindre Times Square. La première gare de Metro est à 8 minutes à pieds, une ligne de bus est toute proche. <br/>Nous avons partagé des activités avec Herman, j'ai adoré cette immersion dans la vie New-Yorkaise ! <br/>Encore merci, Mathieu"
379,478146,2019-05-11,"An absolute gem; peaceful location, cozy and well decorated place, great attention to details, quick response and graceful host. Would love to book again when back in town."
380,515633,2020-03-07,"Communication was great, location was perfect- no complaints from us!"
381,765338,2020-11-28,The apartment on its own is in a good location. The host is not flexible at all by any means. Unfortunately the hot water did not work for a few hours and I had to get back from the gym and go to work with no shower. Worst day of my life. The owner did not give any compensation for that. Very disappointed with this host  and Airbnb in total. Not recommend it.
382,741428,2019-11-08,Heat was not working correctly and  no wash rags
383,761445,2021-10-28,"Super great location, very easy to get around places and amazing food locations right out of the doorstep. Just the right amount of space for our stay in the city! Felt like a home away from home. Great place!"
384,664944,2020-02-14,Great space and great host!
385,847129,2021-04-09,Exactly as described. Great food nearby!
386,827693,2020-10-03,"Bright, spacious, clean, and stylish, too! Jen was very responsive and even provided kitchen essentials. The apartment is in a great location as well, right next to the park. Comfortable beds and quiet building. Would recommend!"
387,311068,2019-05-04,Carlos and his wife were super nice and helpful. They helped us with midnight check-in and late check-out. The room is big and clean and has all necessary amenities. The location was good. We’ll definitely stay here next time! Thank you!
388,401541,2019-04-24,"Great place to stay, especially for subway users who want to get into manhattan (although be mindful of track works as sometimes they can dent your plans!). Clean and modern, very comfy bed. It’s all you need. As a host Scott is excellent at communicating, and makes check in/check out simple and easy. <br/><br/>Positives:<br/>Court street grocers just down the road, amazing spot for breakfast.<br/>Stylish minimalist apartment.<br/>Comfy bed.<br/>A lot quieter than a Manhattan stay at night (however there’ll always be some noise - unavoidable)<br/>Scott’s communication always on point.<br/>Great cleaning products in the apartment! <br/><br/>Negatives:<br/>I’d say the entrance to the building itself is pretty ropey. So just be prepared. Building work is getting done so not much that can be done about it, but that’s the main negative. Once you’re used to it though it really doesn’t make a difference, it’s perfectly safe and a good area too."
389,669541,2021-10-03,"Freddy fue muy amable y dispuesto a atender mis preguntas. El espacio es como aparece en las fotos, fue muy útil para llegar rápidamente y sin problemas al LGA. Creo que para una estancia de un día está bien."

391,695886,2020-02-23,Lissette's place was perfect for a quick weekend trip to NY. Extremely clean accommodations and a private space. Everything we could have needed was provided.

392,657190,2020-03-15,"Tyler’s place is very well situated, close to the park and two metrolines. Finding the place and getting the keys was super easy and Tyler responds to messages very fast.<br/>The room that I had was small and cosy, but it doesn’t really have a decent window and also it doesn’t open. There is no natural light really in the room and it’s pretty stuffy. Bed also feels pretty unstable.<br/>Was not a social house but good for people who want to realx after their workday etc. Livingroom is beautiful."
393,765723,2020-06-07,This place was amazing and I loved the area in general. Allison was amazing with responses and very understanding . I look forward to booking with her again
394,834593,2021-07-26,"The place is good to stay the night, get a hot shower and get some rest, the wc was not 100% clean, but in general we had a good stay,  it is close to a subway station, about 2 blocks, there’s everything near, CVS pharmacy, Popeyes, Dunkin’ Donuts, the only thing is that I wouldn’t recommend it if you are a girl and traveling along or with female friends, the neighborhood might not be 100% safe for women, we didn’t have any problem getting to the apt at night, 11-12 pm but we didn’t feel like too comfortable in the night walking alone, also the streets have a lot of garbage from the neighbors, beyond that, it is a great value, I loved the hot water, the kitchen, you can refill your bottle there, hospitality, no noises, AC, fan, iron, I would recommend it if you are on low budget or not afraid to go alone in this kind of areas."
395,190797,2019-02-22,"I had a great stay at Zheni's place. The apartment is very cozy and the location next to the F/G and a bunch of restaurants is great. It had everything I needed, including an excellent shower. <br/>Just bring earplugs as there's NYC street noise and the house is creaky."
396,779624,2021-10-12,"As advertised! Excellent location, very clean, easy check in, space is well used, responsive host. Would recommend to someone wanting to stay in the West Village!"
397,867179,2021-07-11,"Anybody who really knows Queens, New York knows marble handrails, chrome yard fences and stately eagles, elephants and lions atop pillars that adorn the entrance to the home of every respectable Queens family. While Jakob and his family only managed to deliver on the first of these three markers of respectability (marble handrails), they made up for the want of chrome and elephants by being exceptionally kind and attentive hosts, and by having a clean, comfortable, convenient to public transportation home in which to welcome guests.  Thank you, Jakob, for the memorably pleasant (and even sometimes entertaining) experience. <br/>Note to Jakob: while do please consider the possibility of adding a pair of elephants or lions, I, for one, am no great fan of the chrome thing."
398,713063,2019-07-21,The room is pretty clean and well designed. Very good location. Bret always gave response immediately. Awesome

401,408464,2020-01-04,"Location and value make this apartment a very good find!  Great for a long stay, this apartment was conveniently located on the UWS and came with new refrigerator, oven and was very clean upon arrival.  The space was large enough for two, and I was able to have a Christmas tree and decor around the old fireplace mantle.  The bed was very comfortable and linens were in abundance.  Very high ceilings and great big windows looking onto a more quiet street made the place feel open and relaxed.  And did I mention the location?  Five minute walk to 123, seven to ACE, buses nearby, food, grocery and gyms all around - this apartment was well-priced for this neighborhood."
402,889861,2021-10-28,Great
403,534554,2019-08-19,good stay clean and friendly host
404,887368,2021-11-08,"Pol’s place was perfect! Everything was as described and the rooms were actually bigger than expected. We traveled for the marathon and let me just say, the beds and couches were SO comfy. Location was perfect as we had everything we needed in the general vicinity. Neighborhood was very quiet and safe and it was super helpful to have a parking spot in the back since street parking was a little crowded the weekend we visited. Pol was honestly the best host! He was extremely quick to respond to any and all of our questions/concerns and had a ton of great food suggestions up his sleeve. 10/10, definitely coming back!"
405,775909,2021-10-31,"This place is incredible!! The hosts are so responsive through both AirBnB messaging and text which made everything easy. They aren’t kidding when they say it’s a quiet Times Square apartment… I was shocked at how quiet it was! It’s a great location, so close to Times Square and Hell’s Kitchen area… and safe, too!! Really easy to get Ubers or taxis in that area if needed. The place was clean and spacious, and perfectly accommodated me and my 4 friends! There is also an air mattress (that we didn’t end up using) if you need it, came with sheets and blankets and everything! Overall a lovely stay with great hosts and an awesome price point for the location and size!!"
406,761043,2020-01-08,Mauricio was a great host. The emplacement was perfect and the appartment was clean.

Located in the midst of Prospect Heights and practically next door to the subway, all of Brooklyn’s great restaurants, bars, and attractions are easily accessible. The unbeatable location and outstanding hosts make this stay a great value for the money."
408,673930,2021-05-10,The space was very accommodating and quiet. Air temperature was always spot on. The location is good if you are familiar with Brooklyn as it easily accessible to other neighborhoods. Felt very homey. & the bedding was so comfortable
409,886842,2021-11-14,Underwhelming
410,130842,2019-06-21,"This place is very nice, it's in a good<br/>location that is walkable to coffee and restaurants, a short walk from the river and the space itself is quite nice, very clean spacious common area, and the rooms were a bit larger than I expected."
411,13661,2021-09-06,"This was the perfect accommodation for my girl and I. Located near the 6 line made it easy to go up and down NY. The hosts were very respectful with privacy ( I think I only ran into them once) and they were kind enough to refill our water jugs every time we ran out.

428,680503,2019-08-18,"We really enjoyed our stay at Eric's place. It is a nice, modern apartment with all the necessary amenities and it was very clean when we got in. The apartment  has no windows, but it didn't feel claustrophobic at all. The area may seem a bit dodgy in the beginning, but it's actually a very lively neighbourhood and we never felt unsafe, even when we were walking back home in late hours. The subway station is in walking distance from the property (around 10 to 15 min away) and it takes the train around 30 min to get to Columbus circle in Manhattan. Our communication with Eric/Mariano was smooth and they were always wiling to help when needed."
429,845671,2021-04-10,Justin’s place is a great view of the financial district and a gorgeous view of the water.
430,693643,2019-12-21,"Lovely, stylish ground floor apartment in New York. Suited me and my children perfectly for our visit. Slightly noisy, but to be expected given the style of building and location - but it all added to the atmosphere."
431,529770,2019-11-13,"Lavonne’s place was amazing. There was everything you could need, she was super responsive and the place was very clean. They do live upstairs, so there is some noise from that so keep that in mind, however it did not bother me in anyway, they were super respect that there were guest downstairs. The space was awesome and I plan on staying here again!"
432,613765,2020-07-09,Just as advertised and amazing hospitality
433,705666,2021-06-21,"This is a fabulous place. Furnished so nice and all the comforts of home. We didn’t cook as the restaurants in nyc sooooo good, but everything is there! We had a few hot days and the AC was so nice. <br/>Asya is so warm and friendly. Responds to texts super quickly! <br/>We walked everywhere. Book this spot but not when i want it!! <br/>Thanks Asya."

437,732615,2021-08-18,"Five Star Stay! Communication with David was easy and pleasant. I felt safe and the accommodation was cozy, with a great AC and a comfortable bed. I don't watch TV, but there is a nice one. The shower was powerful and the water was hot. I loved the location because I have a bicycle and was able to get to Brighton Beach and Manhattan Beach (a mile or so) and over to the Rockaways (over the Marine Bridge Parkway Bridge, around 4.5 miles to Riis Beach, I think). I had a great time. It was easy for me to lock my bike in the driveway. I would have extended, but it was already booked again! Thank you, David."
438,493852,2021-10-01,"Pet's place worked perfectly for us. We were visiting our son who recently joined Columbia and we enjoyed being at walking distance from his house and the University. We also enjoyed riding around Manhattan using Citybike, with a station just one block away. At night we prefered  (and recommend) taking a taxi or Uber to be on the safe side, although the metro line is also just two blocks from the building. The apt is in perfect condition and offers you all you may need. Spacious, great bedding, excellent appliances and utensils. Pet (and Nivea) was always available, responding immediately to all our questions."
439,275618,2019-11-22,Faith's place is a great place to stay. Convenient short walk to the subway. Nice and clean. Perfect spot to stay.

444,731188,2020-01-18,"Ronnie saved me last minute from the negative experience that I was having at another Airbnb. I'm so thankful that his room was available. It was a short stay, but it was exactly what I needed. I felt at peace and right at home right away. The room is spacious and clean. He was warm and responsive. Thank you Ronnie!!"
445,583853,2019-01-03,It was a nice stay
446,796066,2020-07-23,"Daniel and Helene’s place is wonderful. Spotless and charming with lots of room. I was also able to park right outside with absolutely no problems, which isn’t always easy in New York.  Conveniently located with a well stocked market right on the corner. Check in was a breeze and communication was great! Can’t recommend highly enough. Thanks Daniel and Helene!"
447,442043,2019-03-06,"Very nice apartment , super clean and comfy, well appointed ,on a quiet street .Helen and Alfred are great hosts : very welcoming   and easy to communicate with. The  neighbourhood also has  everything you need around the corner from cafes , restaurants and groceries , near prospect Park , and beautiful streets lined with typical brownstones.<br/>Several subway lines 5-10 walk from the house , very convenient to travel around Brooklyn and Manhattan.<br/>We had a very nice stay and would definitely stay there again."
448,755722,2020-02-22,"In short; this is the place you want, great value, great location, great host, strongly recommend it.<br/><br/>But, for a more in depth review there is so much more to be shared, finding a good place to stay is important when travelling and this AirBnB helped lay a foundation for an excellent excellent vacation. There is no complaints we can make.<br/><br/>First of all, check-in was very easy, Carolina was ready waiting for us, showed us everything we needed to know and finding the location was very very easy. Its in a nice, quiet area of the Bronx very close to the subway.<br/>The AirBnB has lots of space, its very comfortable to relax in, there is lots of drawer and cupboard space which all around makes it very easy to make yourself unwind and feel at home in. We stayed for two weeks and going out every night and day can be tiresome so it is very easy to kickback and watch a movie at night, play some cards and just wind down.<br/>Going into more detail about the location, being situated right by Freeman Street Station you are roughly 20 minutes into NYC, the station is right by a 24 hour bodega , a pharmacy, dollar general, restaurants for a quick bite to eat, a laundromat, a liquor store, grocery store and almost everything you need is within a short walk. It's also not too close to the city, its very peaceful, very easy to rest up in after a long day in the city.<br/>The Bronx also has a lot to offer, public libraries if you're still studying like myself,  pool & snooker halls, parks, daycare, its all in this borough.<br/><br/>But, with all that being said, I would strongly recommend this AirBnB stay, book ASAP because it will be difficult to find a better one."

453,58603,2021-10-31,"Kim is one of the most accommodating people I’ve met through Airbnb. I stayed with her for a month and worked from home through much of it. She has great internet connection and plenty of entertainment options for when you have a little free time. The spot is also in an area of Harlem that is accessible to many trains, so you won’t have a hard time getting around town. Kim is a true host who will even cook you a nice dinner if you let her. Even her cat, Deena, was a pleasure to get to know!"
454,80555,2019-12-09,"The apartment is conveniently located just a 5 minute walk from the 1 train which will take you all the way to the South Ferry. It was so easy and effortless to travel from Lupi's apartment. As a single female, I never felt threatened or scared coming back ""home"" late at night, although I didn't return later than midnight. The bedroom was clean with a very comfortable bed and 2 mirrors and enough hanging space and hangers. The bathroom was also clean with good shower pressure and nice warm water to warm up after a day out in a very cold NYC. There were other travelers in the house, but everyone was respectful and kept the areas clean. I also never waited to use the bathroom, which is shared with the other tenants. Overall a great and comfortable stay, with all the basics one might need for a 4 night stay. Thank you Lupi!"
455,781398,2019-12-26,Daniela’s place is gorgeous! Very conveniently located near Times Square- literally a 2 minute walk. Located right above a Starbucks and this incredible sandwich place. Some of the best broadway shows on the very same street!
456,820805,2021-09-06,John was very responsive as a host and easy to coordinate with. We had 2 small kids with us and he made sure to leave kid friendly items and snacks for us - really thoughtful! Parking was very easy which is not always true in the Rockaways.
457,403277,2019-09-05,Muy mejorable. Tuvimos problemas con la limpieza del apartamento
458,847579,2021-08-14,Communication could be better - never responded to an issue withthe wifi and didn’t provide access info until the morning of the arrival day.
459,847693,2021-10-03,This place is great for group trips! It is quite small so make sure you’re not planning on spending a whole lot of time there. It was the perfect place for our girls trip where we explored the city and use it purely for sleeping/getting ready. There is AC in the apartment and all of the other amenities worked. The building itself seems like it had a lot of Airbnb’s. There was a person always at the front desk which made me more comfortable being in the city.
460,292684,2019-04-13,"The location is ideal, in a quiet area, just minutes away from a central subway station. The appartment is charming and cozy. And Leslie is a caring and discreet host. I recommend this place !"
461,742952,2021-06-05,"Great location. It's a little noisy with the train, right next. But apt is super convenient and very very accesible. Great pizza shop across the road. I had so much fun discovering the area!"

464,857294,2021-10-15,"The place is very clean, and comfy, Shondelle and her mom are really nice and the communication is great, she answers really fast, also the check in process is really simple, the place is 20 min walk to the train station but you can also ride a bus closer ir you dont want to walk that distance."
465,732925,2020-11-08,Great place to stay.
466,46417,2021-08-14,"Michael's apartment is the perfect stay. I stayed for 1 month. The pictures really do not do it justice. It is large, stylish, and a great deal.<br/> It is in a lively part of Harlem with so many amazing restaurants in every direction. You're only a block or two from multiple subway stations that can get you anywhere in the city with ease. Not to mention you are only a 10 minute walk from Central Park. If you need an extended stay home away from home, book Michael's place"
467,670978,2019-11-19,"We’ve had an amazing experience at Julie and Pierre’s place, it over-achieved our expectations. <br/><br/>Their hospitality is excellent, the house is very well organized, clean and nicely decorated with all the facilities you might need. Maybe even more importantly, the location. The subway station, starbucks, grocery stores, bars and restaurants are all around the corner and within a 5min. walk. That makes it very convenient and you’ll be in downtown Manhattan in roughly 20mins. Additionally, the neighborhood is and feels very safe, also during the late hours."
468,752909,2021-07-29,"Although the pictures look too good to be true the apartment looks exactly how pictured. The other residents are very friendly in the building, and me being a native New Yorker, the sound of the train wasn’t bad at all :). There are so places places to eat within walking distance and night life is pretty active as well"
469,818154,2021-09-14,The apartment was very clean and the host was accommidating to we needed.

475,585548,2021-08-18,"This was a perfect space for me, a solo traveler meeting friends in the city. I was able to relax in comfort, cook food in the lovely open kitchen, and share a meal with friends in the backyard. The bed was very comfortable. I’m familiar with the neighborhood but the location of the apartment was perfect, some great restaurants/bars very nearby, cute little stores, and mostly quiet location especially for a garden level unit. Anna was a very communicative and welcoming host. Would definitely stay again."
476,532899,2019-06-07,"Logement situé à proximité de plusieurs lignes de métro qui emmènent directement à Manhattan (compter entre 20 et 40min pour aller n'importe où dans Manhattan). La cuisine est équipée d'un four, un micro ondes ainsi qu'un grand évier et un plan de travail. C'est donc idéal pour un long séjour. Logement un peu sombre mais avec les éclairages nécessaires pour y remédier. Il aurait pu être un peu plus propre mais rien de bien gênant. Pour finir, l'hôte était à notre écoute et réactive à nos questions."
477,646784,2019-02-27,"The apartment is exactly as advertised and in a great location, not too far from many fun things in Brooklyn and a two-minute walk to both the bus and metro. Layla and Emily keep the space very clean and comfortable, abundant in charming decorative touches. What really made the visit an excellent one, however, was the sisters’ warmth and friendliness. They were eager to hang out, chat, get to know me, and offered suggestions for things to do in the city. They even have a cute lil kitty :) I would definitely recommend staying here!"
478,812563,2021-10-31,"I stayed a month and it was awful. Enhanced cleaning, clean and functional blinds and windows, a proper shower curtain, and more towels would be a start. Internet was good. Also, inquire about the square footage as it used to be a studio."

487,407264,2021-10-10,"Ruben’s place was one of the best private room Airbnb experiences I’ve had! The location was great for me since most of my plans were in Brooklyn. Self check in was easy with clear directions, everything was very clean and the bed was comfortable. The shower had great hot water, there was a filtered water station in the hallway, and lots of cute plants. Most importantly I felt safe and cozy as a solo female traveler. I got a chance to talk to both Ruben and his partner Mina and they were super nice and accommodating. Ruben is also very responsive with any questions you might have. Overall it was a great experience, I would definitely recommend!"

494,699675,2021-02-21,Great stay
495,722664,2021-09-26,"This apartment in Flushing was perfect.  It was spotless and had everything I needed for a comfortable stay.  The host even provided coffee, and bottled water which was so nice! The apartment is conveniently located in a quiet neighborhood and close to anything you might need, and a short walking distance to the LIRR. The bed was so comfortable, and there are window units in the rooms so you can control the temperature. There are lots of cars parked on the street, but there is always a spot a street or two over (part of the adventure).  The host was extremely flexible and accomodating, and her response time was impeccable.  I highly recommend Carlyn's place for your next trip to Long Island!"
496,712389,2020-02-28,"Logement très agréable, calme très lumineux, décoré avec goût dans un petit immeuble de deux étages. Les propriétaires sont très réactifs pour toute demande. Le métro est à 12 minutes à pied et permet de rejoindre Law Manhattan en 15-20 minutes. Une adresse formidable !!!"
497,347124,2021-06-29,"While I didn't get to meet Michael in person, the communication with him was great, he's a great host and he has a really nice place, really private. The area is not the best you can get, I didn't have any issues but it can make you feel a little bit uneasy, but the place is really close to the metro, 2 blocks away, so it was perfect. There's not a lot to do in the area, you'll probably need to take the train to get to any attraction or touristic place. Besides that, the place is really good, it's private, it's not noisy, you can get really good sleep, so it's definitely good value for money."
498,188571,2019-10-07,"We had a lovely stay at Alicja's and Dorota's apartment.   Their communication was excellent and very timely,  from my first contact with them, and throughout our time in their lovely apartment.  They are extremely attentive hosts, and  Alicja's niece Dorota gave us a tour of the apartment upon our arrival.  We both have allergies, and Dorota went through extra effort to make sure everything in the apartment was allergy-free for us.  The apartment is very well supplied,  with some snacks, tea and coffee.  The location is excellent in Greenpoint (right next to Williamsburg), and we chose their apartment so we could walk to our nephew's wedding venue.  It is also only a few blocks to a green line metro station, which allowed us to easily visit relatives in Park Slope and travel to other locations in Brooklyn.  McCarren Park is practically next door,  a nice place to take a walk.  The apartment is only a few blocks to Manhattan Avenue, and all of its restaurants, shops, etc., but the street is quite quiet, and is in a safe location.  We enjoyed looking out at their gorgeous garden!  The beds are very comfortable.  Don't miss ""Bagel Point"", a lovely little bagel shop only a few blocks away on Manhattan Avenue.  Thanks Alicja and Dorota for your wonderful hospitality!     Anne and Alan, New Mexico"
499,587581,2021-05-26,The place is located in a neighborhood near Brookdale hospital. Lots of restaurants around the area. The host is wonderful. She responds to your needs very well and even goes above and beyond. I highly recommend this place if you a want a affordable place to stay in brooklyn.

Although located on a busy street close to Times Square, the apartment is quiet and immaculate, with strong air conditioning.

517,667561,2019-04-01,"I was extremely disappointed with my stay...while the pictures of the place are adorable.  They are also misleading. A few times I was told to be careful as a cleaning spree wasn't charged for my stay. However, once I walked into the apt I found hair all over the floor in the kitchen and bathroom areas. Cheap quality towels that look like hospital quality and a bathroom light that went out at night so I couldn't shower before bed. The entrance to the basement apt is at the back of the house and steps, the banister is very unsteady.  The lighting in the driveway to get to the basement entry is very dim so be careful walking around there at night."
518,426593,2019-05-21,Pardis was an amazing host. <br/>The apartment is in a great location. It was comfortable and clean.

550,287209,2019-10-24,"I did not expect a bunk bed in the room - it just didn't correspond to the pictures, which show a normal bed. Because of the bunk bed, the room seemed even smaller than it actually is. It was not a big deal for me, because I was out all day, but still. Not having a working Wifi connection in the room was quite frustrating, and very uncomfortable as I had to go to the kitchen every time I needed to check my messages or plan my day. Otherwise, the place is very authentic, the location is relatively close to midtown and Glenda is a very responsive host."
551,716118,2019-11-03,"Had an amazing stay in Javier's place. Super clean and cozy, felt really at 'home'. Neighborhood is also good, close to the 4-line which brings you to Manhattan in a heartbeat.

Moreover, the previous guest in our room smoked before, and it was quite smelly. The blankets caught that smell. Probably not the fault of the host, but still uncomfortable."
571,659732,2019-07-21,"Micheline was remotely available as she was out of the country. If anything was needed her dad was available ( he was very nice ) and Micheline answered promptly. I stayed here with my toddler and we enjoyed it. One minor hiccup the previous renters had disassembled the air conditioner so it was very hot, but Micheline's father came to fix it quickly. The neighborhood felt safe, and the neighbors were super friendly. Parking was very easy to find. I would highly recommend this location to anyone looking to stay close to JFK in a residential setting. I look forward to staying again when visiting NY. Thank you again Micheline"
572,663469,2020-03-09,Alexa was so helpful and quick to respond to any questions I had. The apartment is conveniently located and was a perfect place for me to rest while attending a professional conference in Times Square.
573,761059,2019-08-12,"The apartment was spacious, clean and comfortable with good amenities for a longer stay (well equipped kitchen and access to a washer / dryer). The honesty bar was a nice touch - although it was difficult to keep my son away from the snacks! Katherine provided useful insider tips on the local area.

576,720966,2019-09-13,"Considering its central location, it may worth the money. The place is very clean and service is very good. It is a little noisy and no elevator for the unit on the 5th floor."

578,780602,2019-11-03,Takeshi’s place is a truly hidden gem. The room is so comfortable and amazingly decorated (actually looked forward to come back every day). You can’t beat the location with few minutes to the subway lines that connect Uptown and Downtown and evening Brooklyn on a single line. It is also close to the East Village which has a lot of amazing places to visit.<br/>Will definitely stay here again.
579,493106,2020-02-28,Excellent place to stay. I've stayed here over 10 times! Everytime it's been a great experience. Plenty of parking around the corner. Place is clean and the communication with Mark and Sheila is top notch. I would come back again!

589,13942,2019-06-17,"This was our first AirBnb experience and also our first holiday with our 12 month old. We were apprehensive but there was nothing to worry about-Vasili’s place in Astoria was perfect for us. He was quick to respond to my many questions and dealt with any problems we had in a timely manner. He also purchased us a new pack and play (travel cot) and this made our stay so much better as there was always somewhere safe to place our baby when we were busy with something. <br/><br/>We were welcomed with a delicious maple and pecan pie from Martha’s Country Bakery which we had planned to visit prior to arriving, so this was a lovely surprise! The train station (Ditmars Boulevard) was a short ~10min walk. Very easy and quick to get into Manhattan. The trains run frequently (but there were engineering works on the weekend, but replacement bus services). <br/><br/>The area that the apartment is in is very multicultural, with lots of cafes and restaurants. We felt safe walking back in the night and did not have any problems. <br/><br/>We would highly recommend a stay here."

The apartment is not in Manhattan, but it’s very easy to get there by subway. It only takes 20-30mins to go to the midtown. In that case, it has a very good price. The subway Line N is a 24hrs Line. So there is nothing need to be worried if you stay out late. And you could enjoy your NYC subway tour during your stay, by the way, that’s my favorite part. It makes me feel like I’m a New Yorker. The neighborhood is very safe and convenient. There are many restaurants,cafes,bars and 24hrs supermarket in one or two blocks distance. But the room is quiet in night. I have very good sleep here. Anyway, I definitely would like to stay here again if I come back!"
638,881357,2021-10-14,"Great location! New, clean and tasteful rooms! Friendly and helpful staff. Smooth overall experience!"
639,747281,2020-03-10,The host canceled this reservation 14 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
640,608788,2019-06-15,"Very conveniently located near the park, and in the middle of a lovely area with lots of shops and restaurants. Apartment is cosy and very comfortable - just like the pictures."
641,167673,2019-09-15,"Staying in Fernando's apartment was one of the best choices of our trip to NYC! It's location is superb regarding the price, everything was clean and Fernando was a wonderful host, always happy to help. Highly recommended if you plan to visit New York on a budget!"
642,501556,2020-01-04,"We had a wonderful stay at Amedeo’s place, absolutely a recommendation for people who want to discover NYC. The apartment is near everything, 4min walk to Central Park, 12 min walk to Times Square. All restaurants and shops near apartment also perfect. <br/><br/>On the first day we had problem with getting a key (was our stupidness :))) ) and Amedeo came in 5 minutes !!! Very nice from him ! <br/><br/>In the Apartment we had everything what we need, actually more then it stands in descriptions !!! <br/><br/>We were there in Christmas time, so we expect a cold time in New York, but in the apartment was very warm ! <br/><br/>Apartment is in the 8th Ave and it’s very save part of the City, so no problems in the night. <br/><br/>A lot of people ask us if there is loud because of traffic and central position of the apartment. But it was normal like in every big city in the world. At night you can’t hear nothing. <br/><br/>At least, New York. City that never sleeps. Beautiful. Christmas time in New York was my dream. And it was perfect !!! I hope we will come again! <br/><br/>Thanks Amedeo one more time!"
643,459817,2019-08-13,"Appartement situé à quelques minutes à pieds du métro. Il est en sous-sol, bien équipé et plutôt calme. 2 grandes chambres (avec bons lits). Confort et design."
644,477296,2019-09-11,"Just know that I had asked Lola if there was a key to the bedroom that I was staying in.   I was told the same day by Lola that she did not have a key to the bedroom.  The lock acts up at times and she repeatedly mentioned that I should not lock the door from the inside while I sleeping because, the lock my stick when leaving and I might get locked out.  She said this has happened before and and has locked out people who stayed there previously. She mentioned that she was out of town and If I locked the door when sleeping and leave out of the bedroom the door sometimes doesn't unlock and there would be no way for me to get back into the bedroom.  I suggested to her that she should change the lock to make sure that it locks along with a key for safety reasons. I felt very uncomfortable knowing that I had to sleep in a room with couldn't lock and knowing that there was another person in the second bedroom.  I mentioned to Lola that I don't feel comfortable sleeping with the room door unlocked and that someone can walk in on me while I was sleeping.   I felt very nervous, uncomfortable and scared. When I left I have to leave the door unlocked.  Weird feeling.  She said well the person there is leaving tomorrow, however another person will be arriving the day after.  That did not make me feel safe.    I will never book there again."
645,643077,2019-09-10,"Wir haben fünf Nächte in Eugenes Wohnung verbracht und sie war perfekt für unser Urlaub!<br/>Es ist klein aber fein! Ideal für zwei Personen. Alles war sehr sauber und gemütlich eingerichtet. In der Nähe sind alle möglichen Cafés, die Subway ein paar Blocks weiter und der Bus um die Ecke.<br/>Wir würden es auf jeden Fall empfehlen!"
646,396345,2021-07-03,Amazing neighborhood. 10 minute walk to midtown subway. Plethora of top rated food options within 15 minute walk in all directions.
647,557511,2019-12-09,Asad’s place is conveniently located near the airport. Street parking looked limited but was not a problem during my stay. This room has a large bed and a sofa. The temperature was nice and warm. The host is very responsive as well.
648,688639,2019-03-05,The room was set up nice very spacious for two people. Vanessa’s communication was on point no matter what time I contacted her early or late her responses were really quick. I left some items at her place and she is mailing it to me the customer service as a whole was great. I would definitely stay there again if I’m ever in Queens.
649,802288,2020-09-14,"Petra was very nice and accommodating. I hadnt been back home in awhile so alot changed in different neighborhoods, however petra home was really nice, i loved the vibe! The location is Excellent if your stay revovles around The Bronx and Manhattan,  if COVID19 wasn't prevalent at this time- i would have NEVER rented a car, pariod. But i had no choice. Its not far from Little Italy which most peopl forget about or don't know about. Its a Bronx gem, just as authentic and inspiring as Little Italy in Manhattan which just makes this location even better. <br/>Petra wasn't just nice and accommodating she is also thoughful. I had some problems with the door code( leftover mommy brain) and it became a thing for me. One night getting in really late , as i was dreading messing around with the keypad - i noticed that Petra had left it cracked open slightly, i don't know if it was for me or not but i was elated because i didnt have to mess with that keypad( it hated me lol) Nice trip good accommodations.  Thanks Petra "
650,857703,2021-10-14,"My parents and I shared this spot for about 9 days and really enjoyed it. The neighborhood is great - full of bars and restaurants, good grocery stores (including the Brooklyn Whole Foods which is close by), and very convenient for public transportation. The only thing to look out for is that it faces the expressway, so there is some traffic noise, but just bring some earplugs for sleeping in the mornings and it will be no problem. The apartment has everything you need - tons of extra linens and blankets, a washer and dryer, and a smart TV. We will definitely stay here again when we’re back in town!"
651,879618,2021-08-15,Great stay
652,455982,2019-07-02,"It is a nice and sunny room, perfect if you stay for a few days in NYC. The room is smallish- but I think that much is obvious from the pictures. It is quite clean and the bed is comfy."
653,690743,2020-07-05,"Jing was a wonderful host. She gave clear instructions, cleaned the place well, and provided everything we needed for our stay. The place was very cozy and I highly recommend this Airbnb for anybody wanting to visit NYC."
654,205238,2019-08-28,"Amazing place, amazing host !"
655,106855,2019-08-30,"This apartment is located in the heart of Soho, which makes it easy for me to go to places. It’s also very stylish and photogenic! However, keep in mind the walk up is a really long walk up. Bringing shopping bags were pretty tiring. The building appeared to be more of a commercial one too and not residential so it felt a little strange."
656,738989,2019-11-24,"Very cosy, comfortable, and warm! Would definitely stay again. Thanks Lucie."
657,369538,2019-01-03,Great experience. Very nice apartment with great location.

659,700609,2020-06-29,quiet & safe neighborhood
660,828821,2021-05-22,The apt is great - it was perfect for my husband and I who were both working from home for over a month. So filled with light! The location in Crown Heights was lovely. Communication with Mimi flowed smoothly throughout our stay. Would def stay again.
661,537915,2019-09-18,Nice and comfortable. Close to subway. Perfect for a short stay.
662,758806,2019-10-28,The room is super cozy and inviting. It was a very quiet stay. Their little pomeranian is extremely friendly and sweet. Both Daniel and his roommate are super cortious. <br/>The commute to the city is a bit long but very straight forward. My boyfriend had a medical emergency during our stay and the hospital is less than a 10 minute walk from the appartement which was very convenient. There's a little mall and a Target down the street.<br/>Be prepared to take a lot of stairs.
663,653039,2019-05-26,Location in the city is great and with the air conditioning on we couldn't hear much out on the street. It was easy to get in and out with the host's access system. Make sure you pay attention to his description of the unit that is outside the apartment because you have to go through the public hallway to get into the main unit at night to use the restroom. He is clear but you need to understand that. Again the placement of the apartment is right off the fun of Times Square and is close to the bus station and transit. Enjoy!
664,891888,2021-12-04,Kalife was a very responsive and helpful host who was always reachable anytime we had questions or needed anything. Place was spacious too. Would recommend.

673,824500,2021-08-09,She was a great host! Super descriptive and shared any details we could have needed. Her home was spacious for New York. Walking distance to all our favorite places.<br/><br/>Awesome definetly would stay there again.

It was very clean and smelled wonderful and was also equipped with everything you could need. Sharon and Bobby were very accommodating and even helped us with some car trouble we were having. Overall an unforgettable trip. I loved it <3"
676,653293,2019-03-17,Jonathanは困ったことがあると素早く対応をしてくれました。<br/>地下鉄からは近く､便利な場所でした。<br/>お部屋はとても綺麗で､ｱﾒﾆﾃｨも行き届いていました。<br/>また利用したいと思います。
677,723623,2021-06-30,"Nice place. Just a few minutes walk to Subway both A and C train and even for L train! About 30 minutes to downtown Manhattan which is very convenient. My room is great equipped with AC (which you really needs it during summer). Nice kitchen with all equipment you need. And last but not least, Andrey is a great host! Nice and fast communication since check in through check out. It's a great stay in NYC for me!"
678,617950,2019-12-13,This is an awesome place to stay! Justine and Adrian will make you feel at home in Brooklyn. Their home is beautiful and the room spacious. This is a great neighbourhood with many bars and restaurants a short walk away. Most attractions in Manhattan are just 30-40 mins away by subway. JFK airport is easily accessible by public transport.
679,712440,2021-04-09,Such a cute and very spacious suite. It was in a great location with many local eats and attractions.
680,879160,2021-10-31,"Moti is a very accommodating host and communicated immediately with us when we needed. The apartment is clean and cozy - the backyard is a big plus for this part of Brooklyn. The neighborhood can be noisy and parking is a nightmare if you have a car, but it's convenient to downtown Brooklyn and right near Prospect Park."
681,887190,2021-10-08,"Great value for four people. The Location in Soho is just perfect with direct access to China town, little Italy and the beautiful streets of Soho. The is a Great restaurant and bar next door where you should plan dinner and drinks."
682,851870,2021-04-29,"James was amazing, thank you so much for your hospitality we want to go back to your place sometime"
683,241663,2019-04-21,"Location was great. I stayed long enough be able to frequent a few of the neighborhood restaurants, bars and markets.  The corner deli came in handy a few times with great sandwiches. Lots of good coffee in the area too. Mattie was helpful, letting me check in early since there wasn't a guest in the room the night before. Easy walk or bus to the Bedford train station which takes you straight into the city."
684,601909,2021-07-01,"This place was absolutely perfect for my needs as a single traveler that needed to get a lot of work done. Strong wifi, clean, functional, lovely back patio, and a one minute walk to Myrtle Avenue with bank, restaurants, laundromats, and groceries. Fort Greene is a lovely neighborhood and the place exactly as described. A great value and would absolutely stay again! Check in was a breeze.<br/><br/>(One thing to note: the back patio is lovely to open the blinds to and for light pouring in but not totally functional as there are no tables or chairs whatsoever to sit in. Still, it was a lovely amenity.)"
685,511860,2019-09-23,"Very beautiful home, everything worked out perfectly. Super clear instructions and very well located, highly recommend"
686,365190,2021-06-20,"Great host, very pleasant will get the place again if need to."

689,676189,2019-05-01,"After 6 days spent here we can say that we had one of the best experience ever. The house is located in a lovely neighborhood, walking distance to the metro and to the ferry to Manhattan - 5 minutes to the cool Brooklyn Highs park. We loved so much the whole house and the view on the garden. The house was super clean, quite and extremely cozy. It’s fully equipped with appliances and all the comfort  - also some great food that Paul and Già prepared for us. Paul and Gia are really amazing people and lovely host. We appreciated so much their support to prepare the trip and during our stay-  we loved the website they shared with us with some valuable tips to enjoy Brooklyn area. We strongly recommend this place to really live an authentic and great New York experience."
690,845977,2021-05-16,"This is a 2 bedroom unit located in the basement. We stayed for 1 night for an early flight out of JFK. The place was very clean and tastefully decorated. There were thoughtful touches like packaged travel sized soap and extra soft towels. There is a kitchenette with dishes and silverware in the common area. The bathroom was very clean and updated. Check in was very easy and Ramneet was very quick to respond to our questions. The only con is that it is very loud when people walk upstairs...like VERY loud. We had a 6am flight so the stomping noises at 1am was inconvenient. Overall, it was a lovely place and was exquisitely clean.  Ramneet was a great host. I would certainly recommend staying here if you are a deep sleeper or do not have an early morning."
691,182146,2019-08-31,Great space.  Nice to have all electronic locks to get in and out.  Walked to the park every day almost
692,649800,2020-10-13,This place was better than expected! The place has its own bathroom and bedroom. It has a small living room with a Smart TV. The internet was really fast which was the most needed thing from our stay. Tajudeen always responded fast and he is a very nice host. There's parking in front of the house. I really recommend this place.
693,690808,2019-04-07,The host canceled this reservation 25 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
694,832709,2021-09-15,"Excellent location, easy parking and tons of restaurants and bars within walking distance. <br/>The park across the street is a great place to walk/run so bring your sneakers! This location has great energy and felt very safe. <br/>Bathroom is in host’s living space but really didn’t pose a problem."
695,748753,2019-07-29,"Hi All, <br/><br/>I personally was disappointed with my stay a Jeys. <br/><br/>The location is fantastic so I would only recommend this flat if you are spending very little time in it. The kitchen is extremely small - too small to cook. The shower isn't great and water takes some time to heat up.  It has air conditioning but not enough for the room when the temperatures are hot hot hot."
696,849908,2021-08-09,Great location!
697,765792,2019-12-08,We had a great stay at Rose’s flat! <br/>The location was great and only 2 min walk to the metro which made it really easy to discover the city. <br/>Rose is a great host and the apartment was clean as expected. <br/>Thank you !
698,389712,2019-11-08,"Our stay at this private apartment was great, we felt very welcome, Lexia is a very lovely and helpful host. <br/>The apartment was very clean and silent. We stayed for 10 days and commuted by subway to Manhattan every day."
699,814179,2021-04-11,"The Local NYC is a very cool and convenient place to stay for a quick trip to NY. Front desk people were very helpful and friendly. Room was clean, compact and had great windows and high ceilings. Only complaint is that the bed was very uncomfortable and the blanket provided was too small for the bed, causing some cold feet in the middle of the night. Still I would stay again for the value!"
700,78861,2021-07-31,Exceeded our expectations! What a beautiful home. Handmade pottery and original art make this home unique with comforting personality. From the hardware to the lighting to every sink in the house - this home is full of surprises that have been collected from around the world. Classic Brooklyn brownstone with tall ceilings and tall windows that pour in light for their healthy plant family. The backyard offered great entertainment for our 4 y/o and we enjoyed cool summer evenings on the deck. Doris was quick to answer any questions and is a kind and thoughtful host.    We enjoyed exploring all the restaurants and bars on Franklin Ave and were especially grateful for the easy parking. Fabulous Airbnb!!
701,446576,2019-09-08,We had a great time. Claudette was super friendly and helpful. Definitely suggest you stay here if you’re visiting the area.
702,818854,2020-07-14,Blaise is thoughtful and made it a breezy stay. The space is clean and stylish. The description is accurate. Wifi was fast and that AC was everything (considering how hot it was out). Enjoyed chatting with him and he even let me use the driveway.
703,554293,2021-05-11,"Ez's place is one of the cleanest airbnb's that I've ever stayed in! Check-in was easy. <br/>I agree with what others have mentioned-- the building on the outside doesn't have much curb appeal but the inside of the apartment is very nice! There is free Netflix/Amazon Prime video for guests, which is a nice touch. The only negative about this place is that because it's on the first floor, there is a lot of street (i.e., traffic) noise, even into the night. But the location cannot be beat--it's right in Times Square and a quick walk from the subway station. Lots of shopping and restaurants around!"
704,702517,2021-07-14,"Great 2 BR in Chelsea near many subway stops. The space has everything you need, a nice deck, AC, and spacious bedrooms and living room. Couldn’t recommend more!"
705,821539,2021-10-16,"El depa es un sitio súper bien ubicado, cerca de estaciones del metro, restaurantes, farmacias. Ubicado a unas cuadras de Time Square caminando. La llegada es muy práctica por código. El depa muy acogedor, limpio, con todo lo necesario para cocinar comidas simples. Puedes ver películas en la tele, hay internet , baño con agua caliente sin problema. Descansas súper cómodo. Excelente lugar para una estancia agradable en Nueva York !!! Gracias !"
706,720306,2019-11-12,Really good location and the communication with the host is very good.
707,843140,2021-01-18,Amazing place to stay in NYC. It’s right across the street from the train also. Would definitely stay here again.
708,587658,2019-03-15,"When staying in the NY area, if you like to be in a place where you can just blend in with the locals and pay local (not tourist) prices for food and services, this is an excellent choice. The Subway was close, which we used every day for excursions in and out of Manhattan. The apartment itself is clean and comfortable, with more than enough places to sleep for our party of 5 -- we had two younger children (7 and 10) and found it to be very kid-friendly. The place was clean and pretty roomy by NY standards. This did for sure feel like a home away from home. There are a lot of steps up to the apartment, so that could be an issue for anyone having issues with stairs."
709,492370,2021-04-18,"How I see it, the karmic implications of leaving an honest review outweigh the karmic implications of leaving a review that could be construed as unflattering.<br/><br/>Room wasn't ready when I checked in. A leak in the ceiling prevented me from staying the first night of my reservation. The host did not contact me to tell me before I showed up. He said I could stay on the couch in his apartment downstairs, which was nice of him, but also not what I paid for. I ended up paying to stay someplace different and was able to check into my room the next day, though I was still charged for the oversight on the host's part. <br/><br/>While my room was spotless when I was able to check in a day late, because three other tenants had been living in the apartment for months prior to my arrival, the kitchen and bathroom were grimy when I arrived. Given the not-insignificant cleaning fee, I expected that these common areas would be clean when I arrived. The host only cleaned these spaces after i-guess acrimoniously booting the previous tenants from their stay early (see the earlier, Italian-language review for details on the eviction fiasco, which I wasn’t privy to before Airbnb asked me to leave a review). The apartment was clean when I checked out though, because I mostly had it to myself. <br/><br/>Bottom line: I think given the experience of the first two weeks of my stay, I paid $1100 for a room worth probably $750. Nice hosts though."
710,458472,2019-09-18,"On my second visit to NY, I decided to stay in Stephen's place. It was a great decision.<br/><br/>This place is comfortable, simple, clean, and very safe. It is bigger than shown in the photos. <br/><br/>Located in a nice neighborhood, in front of a school and surrounded by local shops and a Ride Aid open 24/7 (which is very useful if you need to buy food or remedies at the last minute). The house has the basics (a good refrigerator, coffee maker, microwave, towels, among others), has two large and very comfortable beds (which is appreciated after walking all day), and a good Wi-Fi connection (also appreciated ).<br/><br/>It is next to the subway station, less than 10 seconds! Our touring visit meant that we arrived home very late every night and being so close to the subway made us feel safe by not having to walk so late on our own.<br/><br/>Totally recommended!<br/><br/>Thanks, Stephen! I will definitely stay in your place on an upcoming visit."
711,682463,2020-02-28,Perfect spot to crash for the evening.
712,479186,2019-05-27,"Quiet and calm place to stay overnight in Bed Stuy. Kind hosts, made it feel like a home away from home."
713,491947,2021-01-18,Machels apartment was OK. The pictures aren’t very accurate. Nice space for a 2 day stay
714,790487,2021-10-12,"Clean space, however it’s a small space which isn’t uncommon for the city."
715,804630,2020-09-10,Great communication very comfy!
716,692083,2019-03-02,Lakshmee was a great host! She was always attentive to my daughter who stayed with her. <br/><br/>Great location with a superb host: unbeatable!
717,884591,2021-11-21,We loved the stay. Very clean and beautiful decor.
718,635272,2019-08-01,"Andrew and Adriana are wonderful hosts: Friendly and super chill. Their place is insanely clean, comfortable and steps away from the Metro, in addition to being within walking distance of some great Brooklyn spots. I would definitely stay with them again and/or recommend to a friend."
719,743744,2019-12-22,"This turned out to be the best Airbnb experiences I have had so far. Jose was able to answer all of my questions almost instantaneously, the room was the cleanest place I have stayed in, and he gave me the ability to check in hours before I was supposed to. Definitely recommend to anyone who wants a nice quiet place in New York that’s is easily accessible by the subway system. 10 out of 10"
720,808045,2020-11-08,"Very clean space in a safe and convenient location. Yvette was there to let us in and offered great recommendations for our stay. We also were able to find street parking for our time there, though that might have been a bit of luck on our part. Overall I recommend this place and would gladly come again."
721,647862,2020-10-23,"Accueil excellent et très efficace. Linda est très souriante, elle est de très bon conseil pour les bonnes adresses.<br/>L’appartement est parfait, confortable, le quartier est sympa, ce garer est facile. Je recommande vivement ce logement."
722,869230,2021-11-12,"Henry's room with a double bed and a single bed with a good bathroom and small cooking area, a short walk from subways, restaurants and the theatre district was very clean and convenient.  I hope to visit there again.  Excellent value."
723,836631,2020-12-30,"The location is in the heart of times square, where you can access all the good landmarks in your neighborhood such as central park, Rocker feller  center, ...The subway stations are walking distance away. Eris and her cohost were very friendly, flexible and responsive. We enjoyed the view and our staying. Highly recommended."
724,549163,2021-10-27,"I could not be happier with my ~5 week stay with Jess. From day 1, the place gave off such a bright and welcoming vibe, it was easy to feel right at home. Jess is wonderful and so helpful. The room was spacious and very comfortable, with ample natural light and comfy bed. The location could not be better. I enjoyed the proximity to the beautiful Long Island City waterfront and also loved the nearby restaurants and cafes off of Vernon St. I had a great stay and would recommend Jessica's place in a heartbeat. Thanks Jess!"

727,199113,2019-02-04,"Great, comfortable and secure place. Perfect location, close to the subway. Abel is really nice and helped me around the city. The place could be a little bit cleaner, especially in the bathroom. Sometimes they were noisy at nights but just one or two occasions. But overall, definitely recommend this!"
728,872550,2021-08-08,"If you want an experience of Coney Island Beach and Amusement park, this is a great place to stay. It's an easy ride on the subway, a ten minute drive. Christine was very accommodating of me and my 3 grandchildren, all under 7.  I'm grateful to her for hosting us! We loved Brighton Beach too and also sunsets on the Bay. You may have to circle a bit for parking, especially if you park after 8 pm. There was no way to brew coffee, but by the time you book, she may have one. Just ask so you are prepared."
729,505822,2019-10-27,個室でﾌﾟﾗｲﾊﾞｼｰが守れるので良いと思います。ｺｽﾊﾟは良いです。<br/>部屋もきれいでした。ﾀｵﾙも一つ用意がありました。<br/>対応も早く､気になったことはすぐに教えてくれます。<br/>4階ですがｴﾚﾍﾞｰﾀｰがないので､荷物を運ぶのがとても大変でした。<br/>車道側のため､夜もうるさく､目覚めることがしばしばありました。<br/>冬になると､部屋は寒いと思います。<br/>また､ﾄｲﾚ､ﾊﾞｽﾙｰﾑに行く際には鍵を必要とするので､不便に感じました。<br/>ﾏﾝﾊｯﾀﾝから電車で20分〜30分ですが､週末や夜遅い時間はﾒﾄﾛの本数が少なく､少し不便でした。
730,485325,2020-08-06,Ted & Tony's place was amazing. Any questions that I had they were able to answer them. They were very polite and made me feel great about staying at their place.

Parking can be a headache, especially at night, but it’s not impossible. Late trains available; it takes about 40 min to get to Times Square. Lively neighborhood. Great choice for a weekend getaway!"
734,473525,2021-09-11,"Excellent location in South Williamsburg.  Walking distance to the South Williamsburg ferry, Marcy Ave subway, and lots of amazing restaurants (Peter Luger, L'Industrie Pizza, Sunday in Brooklyn).

The huge backyard was amazing, and the house itself is super spacious and a very short walk to the beach and a short Uber ride to the best going out spots (The Rockaway Hotel and Bungalow Bar). We got to meet a few neighbors and they were all very sweet."
741,790066,2021-09-18,This place has all the basics. If you just need a place to crash for a night with a couple other people this is a great spot.

745,71937,2019-05-02,"Logement conforme aux photos. Spacieux, très bien équipé. Pas trop loin des stations de métro (à 45 mn du sud de Manhattan). Nous étions ravis de nous retrouver dans un appartement si chaleureux après les longues journées à arpenter les rues de NY. Le petit jardin privatif est très agréable. Nikko et Gabriela se sont montrés très disponibles et attentionnés. Excellent rapport qualité-prix !"
746,721997,2019-10-24,"Le logement de Brandon est identique aux photos, peut être même plus spacieux ! Il y a un petit peu de bruit à cause de la rue, mais cela n’est pas dérangeant! <br/>J’ai adoré le style de l’appartement, et le quartier est super avec tout le street art, les petits restaurants à proximité (et la station de métro à 2min à pied). La seule remarque à prendre en compte c’est que les douches sont dans le couloir, alors on croise souvent les autres habitants en peignoirs plein de mousse à raser, mais cela apporte une ambiance conviviale et amusante ! <br/>Super séjour chez Brandon, tout était parfait !"
747,397277,2019-11-26,Wonderful Apartment! Perfect Location! Excellent hosts!

776,825451,2021-03-11,"Tripp was an outstanding host. His space was amazing all of the fine touches with personal art added to the beautiful space. Throughout the stay received a noise complaint, Tripp was very understanding as we complied with Turing down the volume. This location is definitely a quiet time space great for a break from reality. Definitely would recommend staying with trip. Oh how could I forget the fully stocked cabinets of all your cooking supplies and plenty of card games All around."

795,648544,2019-04-09,"I stayed 10 nights at Elizabeth's place while visiting my new grandbaby.  I couldn't make arrangements far in advance as I didn't know when the birth would occur.  Elizabeth was very flexible in helping me make arrangements.  The room was well furniture and clean.  The house was quiet, although you can sometimes hear street noise.  Kitchen facility was fine for my needs of making tea or a snack.  There is a 7-Eleven right across the street which was convenient for drinks and snack. There are many restaurants within walking distance, especially on Cortelyou Road.  I walked back and forth to my daughter's apartment over a mile away and felt safe, even after 9 at night.  It is a pretty neighborhood."
796,504514,2020-11-02,"Excellent location and Ryan is a really friendly and helpful host. The bed was very comfortable, apartment was clean and the couch is probably the most comfortable I’ve ever seen!"
797,597915,2019-07-31,"Margareth’s place exceeded our expirations.  The pictures did a good job showing the space, it was bigger in person but I was a little surprised but not upset at how open the space was. There was a beautiful amount of storage for clothes.  It was a little hard during the 100 degree days without air, but overall it was a very comfortable temperature.  Everything you need is provided and it’s a fairly easy walk to the A/C line. She is very responsive and kind.  I would stay again and recommend this place to others!!"

The location was amazing, everything you could need within a 4 minute walk including the metro, quick bus to LGA, shops and more. My one issue was that the mattress in that room is hard and uncomfortable. Other than that I had a great trip!"
802,584510,2019-03-31,"Recommended the place of Roman, everything was excellent he is very good host and the apartment as in the photos, very clean and well located, I would return here if a visit NYC again."
803,740179,2019-10-27,"Amazing location and very cute!  There's no microwave, but we figured out how to reheat things on the stove pretty quick.  We were worried about street noise with it being in Manhattan, but it's not on a major road in Chinatown, so the nights were not bad at all!"
804,685002,2019-10-04,"I was just looking for a last minute place to stay and sleep , paco was excellent and he responded so quickly , The place was located in a great area , round the corner from the MET and central park many shops and restaurants also , Paco was very nice he always try to show me what's the best to do and helped me plan my short stay , room is small and great 1 or 2 people to sleep and run to see and NYC. <br/>I recommend this place for exploring NYC"

The floors were very clean. Secure entry and seamless check in check out. I was able to park along the street, the car was safe. I could see it from my room. Secure home. Probably the best deal for my stay, since hotels can be super questionable. This was a very restful stay!"

814,764844,2020-09-10,"Martha’s place was great. Super clean and tidy. Lots of extra outlets to charge things up. I was able to plug in my PlayStation and game the night away. Cute little kitchen, with microwave no stove (perfect for me I wasn’t planning on cooking). Lots of good options around. Parking is easy to find."
815,316724,2019-08-14,"Steve's place is a great gateway to the city of New York. It takes only 10 minutes to get to the nearest subway station, and from there, the city is yours.  Steve embodies hospitality - he offered me food, drinks, and tips about where to go for good experiences. Expect a great stay!"
816,821451,2021-06-24,"Our stay was wonderful at shullys place. They even give you some groceries and recommend places for you to see. Really thoughtful people, I would recommend to stay here if you’re visiting"

820,683869,2021-10-09,"This place was perfectly centrally located for everything we were doing in NYC! The team working here is extremely friendly and helpful! The rooms are small, but it’s like Las Vegas, your only in the room to sleep and shower and stow your luggage. We were also impressed with how quiet it was at night. The price is reasonable and definitely cheaper than a hotel. We highly recommend staying here!"
821,748381,2021-01-18,"Beautiful space, comfy room. I would stay again!"
822,605292,2021-09-23,Jackie was very kind and communicative. I enjoyed my stay.
823,865687,2021-07-28,"I don't say anything bad about anyone but Il try to communicate this as gently and accurately as possible. <br/><br/>Owner communicates but there were several SERIOUS issues.<br/><br/>Pros:<br/>Good location.  Easy commute to Long Island, NYC, or airports. Which is great for individuals traveling for business.<br/><br/>-WIFI works very well<br/><br/>Cons: <br/>-Infestation with very large ""insects"".  No one should pay to live under these conditions it's unsanitary. Especially during a pandemic. These specific ""insects"" carry and spread diseases as well as are associated with asthma. This was extremely disturbing and saddening.<br/><br/>-listing stated onsite parking, parking was only on the street, but there was always a nearby parking space<br/><br/>-listing reported TV was available and working. TV did not work at all. <br/><br/>-No AC which didn't bother me at all but is notable because there is no fan either.<br/><br/>-Several other concerns regarding sanitation and cleanliness. <br/><br/>-Owner messaged me at one point demanding payment from me directly, which is unheard of because air bnb handles payments and all payments are made prior to booking. I had to contact air bnb to contact him so he could stop messaging me. This occasion was very stressful.<br/><br/>-Individuals upstairs walk around until 2-3 am in the morning most nights of the week. Which didn't bother me because I can sleep no matter what but its a notable issue.<br/><br/>- The entry to the apartment is a small basement door entry from the back yard. I am not tall and I could barely fit through it. If you are bringing certain large items you will not be able to enter large items into the door way if you are 5'8"" or taller you will most likely need to ""duck"" to enter<br/><br/>-There are 2 additional entries into the unit. One is from the garage. For the other entry, the individuals that live in upstairs unit have access to lock and open which is VERY UNCOMFORTABLE because the lock is on their side of door so they can open and come in your area at anytime. I know this because I seen him do it on my first day when he introduced himself.<br/><br/>-Over all this was a very sad experience for me. It was my demanding job and the higher expense of another unit at short notice that prevented me from just leaving immediately.<br/><br/><br/> I tried to resolve these issues with the owner  all he said was he would refund me for having to buy inspect spray which I never received. Through air bnb I  was awarded partial refund because I left a few days early.  Unfortunately I did not leave right a way because I was in the area for business and I was over whelmed with work from 6am - 11pm and only had free time at night. My job was merciless but once project was completed I packed and left. Looking back this was terrible experience, I wish I left earlier, but anyone who travels for work that is demanding understands its extremely difficult and very expensive to just move in the middle of a project.  This entire experience was very saddening for me. I absolutely feel like  I was scammed for an infested unsanitary basement apartment. Air bnb should update their terms and have homes physically  reviewed and checked before they list them to ensure they follow safety and sanitation precaautions. and that listing has everything it states."
824,612732,2021-11-19,The room is very clean and the bathroom is cleaned daily. It is a peaceful place to stay in and I strongly recommend.

834,561436,2019-04-09,"Reasonably priced place in this area. It's a clean and comfortable room with a shared wall with Adam's mother's room. The apartment is a small NYC apartmen, and the bathroom is especially tiny. The room is on the second floor facing a street with round the clock  traffic including heavy trucks, so not great if it's hot out and you're noise-sensitive. Very centrally located in Williamsburg and a good enough value"

837,685284,2019-09-17,Location was good! Near a subway station and a confortable place.
838,779888,2019-12-26,"Great location. This was a beautiful home with privacy, excellent amenities and hospitality!"
839,802646,2021-10-03,"Great location, with lots of natural light in bedroom and common area, with everything you need. Clean for the most part and hosts were responsive."
840,198098,2019-06-06,J.'s place was clean and the location was excellent. One of the best Airbnb's I've stayed in NYC. I will definitely consider his place for my future travels to NYC.
841,621504,2019-05-22,This time was my first Airbnb.<br/>I was so comportable and I made new friend.<br/>She is so so nice :D<br/>The room doesn’t have wall but that was so private!! I will miss her and her’s small and lovely cat.
842,407588,2019-12-29,Amazing place. Amazing owners. Amazing location. This place has it all. Definitely would recommend to anyone who just needs a place to sleep and relax when your not in the city. They made us a very nice breakfast after our first night which definitely helped give us some extra energy for our long day in the city.
843,856915,2021-05-26,"The stay here was awesome. For the price that we paid it met our accommodations. The only thing I would warn future guests about is the post states in the amenities that there is off street parking. This was something that we wanted in our Airbnb. The parking at this location is street parking only, and you are fighting with the locals to find a spot close to the apartment. Other than that, the stay was great!"
844,890006,2021-11-26,"This place is the perfect spot to stay while you explore the city. So clean, so cute and Saba is really really nice!"
845,484630,2019-07-19,A big place with all the comfort you need
846,357637,2019-03-13,"Pete's place is one of the best Airbnb I've stayed so far. Spotless clean and great location. If you're a foodie, I highly recommend Pete's. It's surrounded by lots of popular restaurants and local gems. Easy access to the subway as well. The place is quiet which is hard to find in Manhattan. Good bedding and spacious room. Pete is very friendly and very thoughtful. I'd definitely stay at Pete's again when we have another chance to travel in NYC."
847,819930,2020-08-14,"This condo was great. Really liked the neighborhood, parking was easy, there are many options. We were even able to park on the street a couple of times.<br/>Check in was easy, there are doormen in the building that can help with luggage if needed.<br/>The apart was super clean, and really had everything you need. The full kitchen for us was a plus, fully functional and even has a dishwasher! <br/>There are also many many options for restaurants and take out. There is a little market super close.<br/>We really enjoyed our stay, and definitely would recommend."
848,878506,2021-11-21,"great location, clean and stylish"
849,526318,2019-05-19,"We've just come back from a lovely few days at Travis' apartment. It was great. A few minutes walk from a metro station which goes all the way through to Manhattan. The apartment was clean and tidy. The bathroom and kitchen are newly refurbished and included a spa type shower with clean white towels and the most gorgeous bath/shower products (shampoo, conditioner and shower gel). It took us a while to get out the apartment in the morning because the shower and bed were so comfortable and inviting! <br/>Travis responded immediately to messages which reassured us that he was available if there happened to be any issues - which there weren't. <br/>Also  useful to know, on the way home, we got a bus all the way to the airport (bus stop 1 minute walk from the apartment) which was so easy and meant no having to lift heavy bags for long. <br/>Overall a great place to stay and we would go back again."
850,448663,2019-02-28,good place for an overnight connection at LaGuardia.
851,539434,2019-11-10,An excellent place to stay while visiting New York. Stayed at Maggy's place several times while visiting family. My first choice over any other lodging choices.
852,799183,2020-12-06,Very comfortable stay.
853,780023,2020-12-20,"Eynat was a great, responsive host who was very willing to work with me to make sure I was happy with my stay. Thank you Eynat!"
854,760340,2021-10-23,"Milton’s apartment was very clean, modern, and close by restaurants/subway! I would recommend staying here if you wanted to explore more of Brooklyn and experience a different side of NYC. The check in process was quick and fast."
855,771848,2019-09-23,We wanted a nice little room to be able to rest from our travels in and out of Manhattan and Brooklyn and this was the perfect spot! The room and location are just as nice as the pictures and Tara and Bobby were spectacular hosts. They were very welcoming and friendly yet respected our space in the room. Also gave us quick responses and great details for the house and travel. Transportation is easy to figure out and get around as there is a train stop right around the corner. It’s about 45 min to the city but it really seems like less time. We really enjoyed our stay.
856,850291,2021-11-04,"Great apartment, and even better hosts!"
857,602230,2020-08-07,.
858,876936,2021-08-11,Everything was great except the fact there was no broom or mop to clean up.
859,771671,2019-09-08,Location was near buses and the J train and the bed was really comfortable
860,402733,2019-08-27,"Authentic NYC neighborhood experience. I enjoyed walking up and down Atlantic Avenue beneath the J train, looking in shop and restaurant windows and eating down-home rice n beans. Nothing to do at night, but that's ok; being a basement apartment with a quiet little hidden bedroom, it refuge for a light sleeper. There were thoughtful touches (a Metro Card and a Stop n Shop card), and squeaky clean accommodations."
861,634500,2019-12-12,"We spent a good time in the room which was very comfy with good bed, Netflix on the TV."
862,781241,2020-01-06,"Brigid's place was just as described.  It was clean, updated and the bed was comfortable.  This was only about a 15 minute drive to JFK and much more reasonable than staying at a hotel.  If we have a need, we would stay here again.  It is a small place though, so really not suitable for more than 3 people.  There are also plenty of fast food and other restaurants nearby for grabbing a quick bite to eat on the way to JFK. However, the MacDonald's nearby does not open until 6am. We thought all McD's drive-throughs were 24 hour (obviously not Brigid's fault!  Just thought I'd mention it).  Lastly, Brigid was very responsive to email, phonecalls and texts!  Thanks, Brigid!"
863,873058,2021-09-27,"Great cozy place, walk to the subway, great restaurants, and just a nice place to chill and relax. Kevin was super, very attentive and took care of every need. The outdoor deck in the building is also a really great perk as well. Definitely would stay again."
864,116817,2020-10-12,"The place is very cozy and super comfortable, location is great, the host very generous!"
865,391175,2020-02-18,Jenson is a wonderful host! She was so quick to respond and super helpful if we needed anything. Absolutely lovely. The studio was lush. So cute and exactly as it looks in the photos & descriptions. The location was great too being super central. Will definitely stay again next time I’m in nyc!
866,833563,2021-07-18,Nice place everything as expected
867,657932,2021-06-05,Always a pleasure to stay here and looking forward to go back soon!
868,380166,2019-12-18,"La llegada a la casa es muy fácil, a una cuadra de la casa se encuentra la estación , el cual facilita la llegada al centro de la ciudad, tomando la línea express llega en 20 minutos a las zonas turísticas"
869,514727,2019-08-06,"Super logement !!! La localisation est très bien, à 7-8 minutes à pieds du métro Utica Avenue (ligne A-C). Utica Av. est une station express ce qui s'avère très pratique pour rejoindre rapidement le pont de Brooklyn ou même Manhattan. Le quartier est très bien, assez calme, des petits commerces, pas d'insécurité. <br/>Le logement a la bonne taille pour deux personnes, il a la clim (indispensable en été), il est bien équipé. <br/>Tal & Amarelle sont très arrangeantes. <br/>Je recommande vivement ce logement !"
870,602047,2019-04-30,Ociel e Karla sono stati gentilissimi <br/>Ottima pulizia e precisione. Metro vicinissima Brook ave per Manhattan.<br/>Ottimo soggiorno!<br/>Consigliatissimo
871,45015,2019-04-09,"Great location close to Williamsburg, the 7 subway.  Room was quiet, clean, spacious and well appointed.  Staff are very friendly(this is a suite hotel) and offer a shuttle to nearby Williamsburg.  This is our go to hotel when in Brooklyn!"
872,356960,2021-06-07,Steve knew his city I felt very safe and everybody was friendly.
873,840771,2021-02-18,Lovely Stay
874,776350,2020-10-05,Muy buen hospedaje
875,720458,2021-06-12,"While Jackie's place was well-located, clean, and Jackie was VERY responsive, you should know that Jackie does not live here. The photos are definitely stated and touched up- the apartment itself is older looking. I had 4 different other roommates in 1 weeks time, and while most of them were fine, one couple used my bathroom products, left their stuff all over the shared space, and were not very respectful of it being a shared apartment. I really appreciated Jackie's quick communication but I would not have rented if it had been clearly stated that this was a hostel-type situation. Be forewarned."
876,122441,2019-04-22,Beautiful and stylish place. We had the upstairs bedroom with our own bathroom so it felt very private. The place is close to everything in Williamsburg and it is easy to get to Manhattan on the L train. Lynne was super friendly and even stayed up late to let us in when our flight was delayed quite late. Would definitely stay here again!
877,242352,2019-10-28,"Real NYC experience. <br/>Tons of restaurants near by to choose from. <br/>Transportation is just a 3 min walk as well. <br/>Overall, place was clean and host was attentive in anything we needed. <br/>However,  beware apartment may get noisy due to outside traffic and activities, which is why i started off by stating this is a REAL NYC EXPERIENCE."
878,178170,2019-11-11,"Clean apartment, spacious enough for 2 or  even 3 people. Convenient to subway and therefore convenient to NYC, Brooklyn, JFK. Host is around a lot and therefore easy to get in touch with for check-in, check-out, etc."
879,672798,2019-12-29,"Excellent place, amazing hosts!!<br/>Hannah was very responsive and friendly. The place is great, with amazing view and location. Highly recommend!!"
880,817567,2021-05-24,This was a very nice stay!!
881,874961,2021-11-07,Host was very communicative and the home was a great stay!
882,662665,2021-06-19,Great apartment. It was very nice and clean and had everything you could ever need! Erica was so nice and helped us out on everything that we needed. She was very communicative and responded to our messages fast. This was an amazing stay and we are so lucky to have been able to spend the week here. I would do it again in a heartbeat. This is the place to be! Great location and easy access to the trains. It was right next to some great restaurants and 24 hour bodegas. You WILL NOT be disappointed with this stay. I could not recommend it enough!
883,698779,2020-03-14,"Everything was great! Just as expected. Walls were a little thin but nothing crazy, just had to be cautious about playing music or Netflix. Clean and close to a Subway stop!"
884,285725,2019-12-08,Was such an amazing stay! Great location amazing space. He is so kind and hospitable. Cutest dog!! Had such a great time!
885,604678,2019-05-26,"Great location! Cost effective, nice stay!"
886,460353,2019-10-03,I'm sorry that 5 out of 5. I wanted to give 100 points. It was a perfect hostel for us.<br/><br/>sam was a really friendly host. We could be really at ease while staying at the hostel. It was a perfect space with nothing to complain about.
887,321457,2021-07-06,"Very clean, beautiful apartment"

890,841700,2021-11-29,"The platform is very good, it’s very convenient, and Ms AnnaMarie is very nice ,thank you for what you have done for my son!"
891,821846,2021-07-11,"This apartment is in a wonderful location and is bigger than it looks in the pictures. The host and her assistant are extremely nice and very responsive. The king size bed is extremely comfortable but the pullout couch is not, so it is more comfortable for a couple rather than a family. There is a nice size kitchen, but it is not really equipped for cooking, but there are so many wonderful places to eat in the neighborhood that you don’t really want to cook there anyway."
892,739300,2021-10-25,Wonderful place near by public transport. Comfy bed and cute space to stay in Harlem.
893,550934,2019-07-16,"Wonderful location, great amenities, and a lot of privacy. I’d recommend Alonzo’s place for future travelers to the Queens area!"
894,527216,2019-12-31,"Lucky place was extremely clean and comfortable, and he was an amazing host that goes out of his way to make his guests feel at home. I would highly recommend anyone to stay at Lucky’s place! :) thank you!"
895,142238,2021-09-19,"This is a SHARED space in the sense that the host(s) will use the room sometimes during the day. But I was one of those travelers who just used the room as a place to get five or six desperately needed hours of sleep after a full day of whatever. If that's your style, this is practically a private room, since between 11 AM and 10 PM nobody's in the room. Be prepared for a serious run-down of rules upon arrival, but it's all fairly standard and obvious. It can get pretty warm in the room at night, but there are several fans and an AC unit that can help out."
896,739920,2019-07-08,"Christian was a super helpful and responsive host and his place is lovely! It may be small, but the space is stylish, clean and had everything you’d want. The location was so great, right next to lots of awesome bars and shops and so close to a train stop. Would definitely stay there again!"
897,753838,2019-11-25,"David's apartment was more than I expected. He thought of everything from having a bowl of snacks for us, to very detailed instructions for getting into the apartment, shampoo, conditioner, & body wash in the shower, to plenty of extra linens. There are two bodegas on either corner and Harlem Blues Cafe directly across the street that serves salads, sandwiches, crepes & really good coffee! So convenient!<br/><br/>A few things we did while staying at David's is eating at Jacobs Soul Food at 129th & Lenox (a buffet of soul food - very much a spot locals go to), Red Rooster (more high end soul food), and viewed the exhibits at the Schomburg Center for Research in Black Culture on 135th & Lenox. David's apt is just a few blocks walk to each of these - we so enjoyed this location! This specific corner can get active in the evening but we were visiting from Oakland, CA and that activity just made us feel even more at home. Also it's kind of why we chose to stay in Harlem!"
898,423646,2019-09-15,Lugar limpio y cómodo. Bastante cerca del metro. Mario muy buen anfitrión
899,787825,2021-09-08,Nice hotel
900,621363,2020-01-31,A stylish ultra clean place with a well equipped kitchen. No TV but Manhattan is easily within reach. Very responsive and helpful host.
901,437606,2019-01-28,"The spaciousness of this AirBnB was very nice for what is normally expected of New York apartment. The location was nice and decently quiet during sleeping hours. The only  complaint would be that the bedroom doorknob was broken and would not allow the door to be completely shut. We had to prop a desk chair against the knob for our sense of privacy, which felt a bit uncomfortable. We also had difficulty with the main door deadbolt upon returning late the first night we were there. We were frustrated being unable to figure it out after a long day of walking. We were later able to clarify with Nathan our second day there and we did not have any issues after that."
902,586614,2020-01-02,"It’s a good stay just be aware because of how cold it is, you may run into some bugs , but everything was amazing"
903,421199,2019-04-27,It was a great stay! House was clean. The garden i liked and the suroudings was great. Only point was the Central heating witch was just fixt. I had to look and phone presure cause Risha was away for a few days. The thing could explode she told me. But everything turned out well.<br/>It was not easy to wash in a bath. Missed a shower.
904,878424,2021-10-17,"Our stay was comfortable; the location was convenient. Late check-in was a breeze. We had no issues with the place.<br/><br/>When I purchased a few essential items missing from the place (probably due to previous guests), the hosts offered to reimburse me. Mistakes happen; I appreciate how the hosts resolved them.<br/><br/>PROS:<br/>- Jaw-dropping NY skyline view<br/>- Responsive, thoughtful hosts<br/>- Superb location. CVS, 24/7 Duane Reade, and Target within 1.5 blocks.<br/>- Building amenities: laundry room, gym, rooftop common area, doorman<br/>- Good creature comforts: effective air conditioning, plenty of hot water, gas stove.<br/><br/>CONS:<br/>- Only 1 bedside table<br/>- Shower curtain liner could have been cleaner"
905,786838,2021-06-09,Great host. Great location.
906,310910,2020-02-16,Great place and great value. Sparkling clean and Ben was very responsive when needed. Would definitely recommend to others looking for a place to stay in BK!
907,786902,2020-10-18,I always have a great experience when I stay at Shera's place.  I have rightfully named her place my second home whenever I come to NYC!!!!
908,252058,2019-06-29,"Kate's place in midtown was just what I needed. It was comfortable, cozy apartment. All of the facilities worked fine - as you'd expect - and the AC did the tricky when the weather got too hot.<br/><br/>Kate herself, though not staying in the apartment, was a good host. She was friendly, gave me some great tips about the neighborhood when I was checking in, and even left me with a selection of snacks and sweets!<br/><br/>Would definitely stay again if the opportunity arises in the future"
909,386418,2019-03-30,Great location for commuters and travelers
910,634907,2019-04-30,Irma’s home is VERY clean and neat!!! Quite modern and nicely decorated. We had everything we needed - enough towels and kitchenware for a home made meal.  The bedding especially exceeded our expectations. The location is walking distance from the subway.<br/>Irma shared local tips and answered questions quickly.
911,777521,2020-02-22,"First, I want to thank Mrs. Dierdre and her family for being the best hosts I have came across. I stayed at her place alongside 3 other medical students, we were there for 6 weeks while attending RUMC. Upon walking in we were amazed at how much her place felt like “home”, breakfast bar was amazingly tasty! This place was safe, quiet and everything we needed. Everything was sparkling clean. She was quick to respond and very helpful. <br/>Overall we enjoyed our stay and will definitely recommend to anyone who’s looking for a place they can feel at home."
912,809620,2020-05-27,Great space and host
913,616843,2019-11-05,"Janet’s apartment was exactly what I needed for a week in New York.  It’s comfortable, clean, and convenient, and because it’s on a street rather than an avenue, it is quiet.  There is plenty to see/do/eat in the neighborhood, and if you want to venture further afield, the R train is right around the corner.  Would recommend her place to anyone."
914,778313,2020-03-13,Great place nice n clean just like home very welcoming amenities were great definitely worth the money and would stay again if I need to great host
915,844672,2021-03-28,This place is great literally minutes away from Time square. At night the street changes to a scene with great dining experience for young couple looking to have a intimate setting. All I can say is once you stay here you will want to book it again in the future. Tons of fun and vibes all around you .
916,69713,2021-05-17,Maria is a great host a really nice person and has a lovely clean nice place.
917,769720,2020-06-27,"Host was very nice . We had a no contact check in , which was great being that we’re  in the middle of a pandemic . Upon entering I noticed it was very stuffy in there . Not enough ventilation . There’s a window in the kitchen with a fan that looks like it hasn’t been dusted in ages . Also wayyy to many little bugs flying around . There are holes in the ceiling by the kitchen area . The apartment is overall dusty and dirty . In the bedroom , which is where I slept , I noticed while laying down I was uncontrollably itchy (checked for bedbugs didn’t see any) . It’s an old place clearly , which with a little TLC can acutallly be an amazing place to stay. Host lives upstairs and it was very quiet which was a good thing . It gave me time to relax ! Overall stay wasn’t bad , but the place needs some tending too . Also , there were hygiene products in the bathroom that clearly belonged to previous guest. Oh , I should mention , if you have a waterbug phobia like myself (lol) this isn’t the place for you . Because you will encounter a few."
918,698335,2021-10-11,"Jermaine""s apartment is truly a home away from home. It had everything you would need for a comfortable stay. we slept well. Jermaine was excellent in his communication and helped stop some music noise from upstairs at a late hour to my pleasant surprise. Peter and I enjoyed chatting with him. The apartment is close to the subway, restaurent and cafe. Highly recommend."

930,799635,2021-08-22,"Made sure to check out some sights and attractions that weren’t too far from the home, which was a fun experience! Carol, our host were very responsive and helped right away with any questions and concerns. Unfortunately though, the neighborhood isn’t so peaceful. The neighbors definitely made sure to give us a concert every night and we’re SUPER loud. Nonetheless, if you’re looking for a getaway with tons of space,  this is it!"

935,714051,2021-07-24,Great stay! Very close to subway stations and suitable for someone who needs a longer term place to stay.
936,516653,2019-05-15,"The apartment is super close to the Eastern Parkway subway stop and just up three sets of stairs. It's a gorgeous space and classic New York. I recommend it if you're looking for a place to stay for a short trip or a cool place to hang out in on lazy days. The bed was extremely comfortable and I always slept through the night, and the bathroom is spacious for New York. I would live here if I could. Great safe neighborhood and tons of unique spots just around the corner. I recommend Chavela's for tacos and esquites. Yuval was very hospitable, accommodating an extra person on our previously two person booking for a reasonable price and even giving us an air mattress and towels to use during our stay. Thanks Yuval!"
937,180550,2019-10-08,Akua and Carlton are very warm and kind hosts. They are relaxed and made us feel very at home. It felt like we were staying with friends.

939,700266,2019-08-13,"Michelle's house looked like a picture.  And the subway station is close and easy to move around.  However, it's a roadside on the first floor and it's very noisy at night due to ambulance noise."
940,675324,2020-11-09,"This cute apartment is just right for living it like a real New Yorker.  It has everything you need for a nice weekend or longer, but it's cozy just like most New York apartments are.  The kitchen has useful and well put together.  The couch, TV and little two-top table even works for 3 people!  The bed was a bit softer than my husband and I are used to, but we slept well after long days in the City.  The bathroom was small and well laid out.  It was very nice to have an elevator and the stairs are close by too.  The building is very safe and the entrance well lit.  <br/><br/>And the precautions for Covid were top of the line.  The key is just down the street at the shop on the corner so there was no need to meet us.  The apartment was not only tidy, but quite clean too.  Everyone in NYC is wearing a mask, which was so nice to see.<br/><br/>You'll love your time at Chantelle's place."
941,778268,2019-10-29,"Adam’s place was nice, clean and everything was very convenient. Adam was easy and good at communicating with and this is great vaule for money. Also the area is nice and authentic. Recommended!"
942,318460,2019-08-04,"This location was amazing. The block was quiet, clean and comfortable. The host was great, she greeted us upon arrival and gave us the details and things to know and left us to enjoy our weekend. The airbnb was GREAT. It has everything to make you feel at home even those extra things that we typically forget when packing to go somewhere. The kitchen was stocked for the ones that like to start the day with coffee, eggs and O.J. and almost everything someone would like for breakfast. The rooms were comfortable, clean and cozy. Bathroom had everything you needed as well, from shampoo to soap and body wash. This host is by far the best host. The family loved it, as did I. Anytime I need to stay in Brooklyn, we will be staying here."
943,429575,2019-02-14,"Good location, great parking, close to lots of places to eat and 1 mile from the local ymca."
944,551345,2019-12-16,Definitely recommend this place if you’re looking for something that places you in an area where you truly feel like a New Yorker lol. It’s just far enough from all of the touristy things and just close enough to make the trip a good balance between charmingly local and everything you think of when thinking about NYC. The space is the perfect size for couples in my opinion. Overall an amazing experience.
945,453912,2020-03-20,Visit this place is very nice
946,699246,2019-12-07,The space was great. Much more than what I expected. The apartment has just about anything you may need in case you forget those little things behind at home. It was very clean and cozy. And the host were very kind and responsive.
947,889658,2021-11-05,"great hosts, communicative and helpful, would stay here again!"
948,441933,2021-08-21,Small room but super close to the G train which is a huge benefit. Also close to a nice cafe for working and many delis and bus stops. Pamela replies fast and is very kind. All very clean and the AC is key if you're visiting in the summer. Kitchen is fully stocked too. Wifi had a few blips if you're working remotely but again the cafe across the street is great in a pinch.
949,850412,2021-10-01,"Great place to stay, super clean and convenient to all location at flushing area. will come back again for sure thanks a lot John!"

952,567310,2019-10-19,"Beautiful home and cute space. Everything is very clean and orderly and they provide the basics. Very accommodating with check in and check out. Bed/mattress very comfortable, comforter was very soft.  Might be a little hard to sleep at night if you're a light sleeper. Outside music can be heard pretty clearly but did not go til late. Maybe like 10. Then everything was very quiet. Loved staying here, would stay again:)"
953,754849,2021-02-15,The space was perfect for my needs - clean and cozy.  Julianna and her husband were very welcoming!
954,867474,2021-09-18,"Jessica's place is absolutely perfect for someone who wants to experience what it feels like to be a real New Yorker while still having easy access to all the top tourist spots. <br/><br/>The ambience in the apartment is so cute and peaceful, and the bed is crazy comfortable. Jessica has provided a medium size fridge with a freezer as well as a microwave and some adorable antique looking dishes. The apartment has its own private entrance with a small courtyard and a gate you can lock. I felt completely safe the whole month I was there. <br/><br/>As for the location, I absolutely loved staying in Harlem. It is such a vibrant, friendly community. It really feels like a small town on its own where everyone knows each other. I made so many friends just walking around :) <br/><br/>And Jessica and her family are super nice and helpful. They were very respectful of my privacy but made sure to let me know they'd be there if I needed anything.<br/><br/>Overall it was the perfect introduction to NYC, and I cannot recommend this place enough!"
955,852306,2021-09-02,"Great stay; clean place, good location, and very communicative host. Can't really ask for more "

959,788751,2020-02-21,The host canceled this reservation 113 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

961,354290,2021-06-09,Perfect for a short stay.
962,795001,2021-07-26,"Olga’s room is clean, quiet, and in the best location. It was perfect for us for a weekend trip. We will definitely try to stay here again!"
963,888560,2021-11-27,"La camera è molto semplice, il letto è comodo e la temperatura è gradevole (eventualmente c'è un condizionatore portatile per adattarla alle proprie esigenze).<br/>Il cagnolino è molto affettuoso, non disturba e non abbaia.<br/>La zona è tranquilla, nel cuore di Brooklyn, la notte silenziosa.<br/>La cosa davvero positiva è che proprio sotto casa passa il bus (linea B52) che porta al terminal Downtown Brooklyn / Cadman Plaza, vicino al ponte di Brooklyn,  dove è possibile prendere la metro (A o C) per andare a Manhattan (arrivano direttamente a Times Square) oppure attraversare il ponte a piedi (esperienza meravigliosa); inoltre, a poche decine di metri, c'è un'altra linea (B46) che anch'essa porta a Downtown Brooklyn; infine, se non volete cambiare mezzo e avete un po' di voglia di camminare, avete altre due possibilità: a 1 km c'è la stazione della matro Utica dove potete prendere le linee A o C, oppure sempre a 1 km c'è la stazione Kosciuszko dove potete prendere la linea J che vi porta a Soho/Little Italy. Insomma, è servita molto bene dai mezzi.<br/>Ideale solo per una persona e solo se vi serve un punto d'appoggio per dormire.<br/>Se siete schizzinosi e ossessionati per la pulizia, lasciate perdere e cercate altro.<br/>Se vi serve un posto strategico per visitare da soli New York qualche giorno è un'ottima soluzione."
964,858273,2021-07-10,Great host: very friendly and informative.
965,463396,2021-08-28,"Always there when you need them, whatever it is, and kindness full on. Always fair, what a team player."

969,704424,2019-08-07,HORRIBLE DO NOT RENT!!!<br/>I rented this apt for a week and when I came to check in the door had NO lock completely unsafe and no privacy and scary to be there I wanted to cancel because I don’t feel safe and he wouldn’t give me my money back.<br/>DO NOT RENT if you are worried about privacy and safety.<br/>also has 1 small unit AC all way in back of the house and the house very very hot.

975,695968,2019-11-30,"Donna's apartment is spacious and comfortably located. The 10 minutes walk to the metro station makes everything in NYC accessible. The place is nicely decorated, and it comes along with TVs in all the bedrooms as well as the living room. The price affordable for New York standards. Would recommend staying."
976,509940,2019-03-18,"Nia's place was great!  Super convenient to everything i needed and just down the street from the friend i was coming to visit.  The apartment was clean, cozy, convenient, and Nia was friendly and available when i needed to check in.  I normally stay in Bed Stuy, it was nice to change it up this time!  Cool vibes in Flatbush and the airbnb is close to the subway, easy to get to Manhattan if needed.  Loved it all!"
977,721207,2019-04-22,"Great location and apartment.  Modern, 4th floor, walk up apartment.  Bed is very comfortable.  Host is responsive to questions, hospitable, and provides clear instruction for check in/check out process."
978,656034,2020-01-02,"You get what you pay for...Maybe I got it on a VERY BAD day but that place was so dusty and moldy smelling,  I checked out in 30 minutes...<br/><br/>Cost me a pretty penny to find a new place  with such short notice but goodness, how did that place get those reviews...I thought I was on Amazon for a minute.  <br/><br/>The host quickly refunded the other nights and AnB took care of the rest...The host communication was good but please invest $100 to clean the moldy entrance and clean a carpet, not to mention the unsafe extension cord running directly infront of the door that I almost tripped over."

981,513215,2021-04-04,Good stay
982,635749,2020-02-19,"The room looks exactly like the photos. Cleaning was ok in the room in general, but the sheets and pillowcase was not 100% clean. The location is great, but have in mind that L line could be altered and then You have to take The Shuttle bus to the closest subway station and it's free but the situation can be really inconvenient when You're new in Brooklyn and are trying to no waste time in subway,bus etc. The host was really great, check in was pretty much easy and Sue was quick in answer our messages, really made our stay better."
983,444617,2019-12-07,"Hosts were great, ease of transportation using the subway to and from residence. Great communication and made us feel welcome. Would stay there again."
984,753449,2019-09-24,Camille’s place is great for a visit to NYC. Very close to the 1 train for 30 min train to midtown Manhattan. Close to shops and pharmacy’s.

988,522969,2019-04-27,"Jenny ist sehr nett und unkompliziert und wohnt im Erdgeschoss des 3-stöckigen Hauses.<br/>Die gemütliche Wohnung ist im ersten Stock und groß mit eine sehr bequemen 2-Personen-Bett (Durchgangszimmer), 1 Bett im Nachbarzimmer, 1 großes Wohnzimmer und eine kleine Küche. Alles an Grundausstattung (Salz, Zucker, Spülmittel etc.) war vorhanden. Das Haus ist im Wohngebiet von Brooklyn und Manhatten ist über die um die Ecke gelegene Subway Nr. G gut zu erreichen (Station Myrtle, Willbourough).  Zum nächsten richtigen, größeren Supermarkt mit Frischware (nicht DELI mit Grundversorgung) muss man allerdings schon mal 15 Minuten laufen.<br/>Wir waren zufrieden und werden in 2 Jahren wieder hinfahren. Preis-Leistungsverhältnis stimmt dort, da muss ich nicht direkt nach Manhatten."
989,207923,2020-02-21,"If you get to my review, you’ve probably already heard the amazing things everyone has to say about Luis & Victor but I’m here to tell you, it’s all true and more. You likely won’t fully understand until you meet them both! <br/>Luis & Victor are truly what Airbnb is all about, it’s a genuine home and someone offering you a safe place to stay that not only is incredibly affordable but feels more like a bed and breakfast!<br/>Upon my arrival (which changed a handful of times I might add), I was greeted by both Luis & Victor who spoke fluent Spanish which made me feel even more at home!<br/>They carefully thought about maneuvering bathroom times to avoid schedule conflicts even though the bathroom was always free when I needed to use it.<br/>They welcomed me to the kitchen and dining room table. Plus gave me insight into the area.<br/><br/>The bedroom is larger than the pictures show, the bedding is freshly laundered and the BED OMG THE BED feels like plush. I may buy a new bed at home because of it.<br/>The apartment is spotless and the bedroom has thoughtful touches like smart phone USB outlets, shampoo/conditioner/soap/hand sanitizer/tissues packets and a mini fridge in the room!! <br/>There’s TV (even though I don’t watch TV I still just liked the fact there’s a huge TV as an option) and tons of subtle details that you don’t even think about until you see them.<br/><br/>If you can do anything for yourself and your upcoming trip, it’s booking with Luis and Victor. <br/><br/>Thanks to you both for making me remember why I use Airbnb!"
990,862440,2021-05-09,Muy recomendable.

998,858346,2021-11-25,"The room is great, clean and well located in the Bushwick area. Had a great experience. The only thing is to check if there's another guest in the room next to this one, as if he/she turns on the light at nighttime, it will bring light to your own room because of a little window up there. But overall great experience."
999,815515,2020-09-18,Such a good spot for work and atmosphere
1000,636921,2020-03-03,"If your thinking of traveling to NYC/Brooklyn and want to experience the true community feel, then this place is perfect. The room is extremely beautiful, the sun shines through the window every morning and is just amazing, the private bathroom is a great touch and very clean. The area is perfect for traveling aorund the city, the subway is minutes away.<br/>The area has many shops, restaurants and bars. My favorite being Father a knows Best, I travelled solo for this trip and met some amazing locals, who could not be more welcoming..<br/>I fell in love with this apartment straight away and Dan is an amazing host.  This place is pretty special, happy booking people."
1001,503690,2021-10-07,Linda's apartment was simply perfect. Absolutely spotlessly clean and well organized. The little signs to show you where everything is made it simple to find what you need. Very quiet - a big plus in Bed-Stuy. And when the light bulb began to flicker in the bathroom Linda responded immediately. Food shopping nearby. We highly recommend staying at this apartment.
1002,688274,2019-01-18,"A super cute and eclectic space! If you imagine an artists Brooklyn apartment, this is it. Camilla was super easy to reach for check in and any questions. Being on the fourth floor- it was hard with heavy bags. If you’re traveling light, this place is perfect."

1005,394471,2019-10-28,"The host’s were very kind and allowed us to drop our bags early, that was very helpful. The Bnb is about a 3 min walk to the J train, which was super nice because we were on the go all weekend. The apartment was cute, lots of steep stairs. I Was disappointed in the oven not working (maybe it was just me), and the showers were rough due to the water temps and pressure being very hard to control. Aside from that it was a smooth stay. Nice place."
1006,599259,2020-12-23,Very clean and spacious space for up to 3 people. Ez was super responsive to me. The check-in and check-out process during COVID was reflective of key safety protocols. Nice kitchen space (you can sit and enjoy meal).
1007,771906,2019-11-20,"The neighborhood is very safe, which, as a woman traveling alone, I really appreciated. Plenty of cute restaurants, bars, stores within walking distance. The subway is just a few blocks away and it's an easy ride into Manhattan. Vlad was a perfect host. Very communicative. The apartment was clean and the bed was comfortable. Everything was exactly as advertised. I enjoyed the communal kitchen...I never saw anyone else and it was great to have such a large and equipped kitchen space when needed."
1008,531149,2019-05-17,"We were looking cheaper-than-hotel place to stay and we think this was just right place for that. Communication with Farrel was easy, if we had some questions Farrel was keen to answer. Bed was super comfy and kitchen was well equipped. We also used laundry machines which were silent and sufficient so we could wash our stuff even during the night, it was totally okay. Info about getting to aparment and house rules were easy to understand and did not have too many rules. We felt like it was easy to stay in."
1009,858223,2021-09-26,"Safia is awesome - she helped my group of friends and i make sure we got to our reservation accordingly, and was extremely cordial about it. Professional handling and the apartment was very clean. only slight negative comment i could make would be the air flow, but her accommodations meet needs satisfactory!"
1010,390009,2019-11-18,"If you want a great place close to Greenpoint’s every attraction, this is it. It’s extremely clean, spacious, well outfitted with linens etc. We appreciated the private entrance and the quiet street too.<br/>Ella is a great host."
1011,407922,2020-03-06,"Great experience! Even though Zack happened to be away on vacation during our stay, he was very responsive to every question we had, and his roommate Amanda was very accommodating (as well as the two very well behaved pups!). The place is cozy, comfortable, and decorated extremely tastefully; would recommend."
1012,777729,2021-09-06,"Taela's place is so good, she and Xena are so friendly and welcoming. <br/>The location is so good, line 3 is just one block from the apartment and line A and C like 4 blocks away. I will definitely come back."

1014,220986,2019-09-03,"I loved the location of the place. A really nice neighborhood in Brooklyn, close to metro and walking distance bodegas. <br/>Check-in was an easy process and the co-hosts were very welcoming. We had a lovely conversation about travel and got some tips about the events in the city. <br/>Bedroom and bathroom were very clean. <br/>You can unwind at night on the rooftop or watch the sunrise."
1015,177962,2019-07-14,"Great apt. in a great location.  Jed was awesome communicating and a gracious host. Per other reviewers, the bathroom needs a little work/updating but it worked fine.  The loft bed was very comfortable and our daughter slept nicely on the large, comfy sofa (linens were provided.)  Our party of three was very comfortable there.  Would definitely stay again."
1016,551149,2019-06-05,Mk is very nice and so sweet! I was a little nervous since it was me staying in the living room but it ended up feeling like I was just staying in a studio! She is very helpful if you have any questions or concerns! The location is absolutely perfect to be able to get around Manhattan as well!
1017,774970,2021-07-10,"Me and my Husband had such a wonderful experience visiting our old neighborhood thanks to Banty. Quiet and clean atmosphere.

Communications with Sarah, Super Host was immediate and she was more than accommodating registration until check out.  Her apartment is meticulously designed, sparkly clean, and comfortable. Newly renovated with great internet and all the organic touches. The large queen bed was absolute heaven!! I would stay here every time I come to NY if it were avalible. Thank you!!"

1034,67466,2021-06-23,"I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here. I felt very much at home. Great location, beautiful place. The garden is better than the pictures. I hope it is available on my next trip. I have stayed in about six Airbnbs in Brooklyn and this one is by far the best! I shall return!"
1035,51657,2020-08-31,We had a wonderful stay at David’s apartment. The location was perfect and it was very spacious!
1036,578067,2019-07-01,"Cool little apartment if you’re looking to see NYC on a budget.  The closest Subway stop is under renovation (as of 7/1/19) which made it a little less convenient getting to the train, but was still relatively easy to get in town.  Really close to a nice park with a bridge view.  Quiet street."
1037,418223,2019-04-27,Bel appartement... Un peu rudimentaire mais convient
1038,833702,2021-08-26,"Frank is a great host, and has a terrific apartment to offer at the southern end of Prospect Park. He has taken time, effort and creativity to create a welcoming and comfortable space. The kitchen is well stocked, including an array of staples, a microwave, and an eat in table. Two window unit air conditioners more than do the job, even in a heat wave. The bathroom is also spacious, and he offers a nice array of bath salts and such for a soak in a large old fashioned tub. The neighborhood is a great mix of long time residents, people from many and diverse cultures, especially a newer “Little Caribbean” identity. That makes for great food options, be it grocery shopping, carry out, or bodega runs.  It’s all at your doorstep if you stay at Frank’s place."
1039,562038,2021-08-20,"Judith Michelle was a gracious and wonderful host for my month-long stay. The apartment is beautiful and perfectly located - close to Times Square, the highline, and Greenwich Village. The room was spacious and clean. I would recommend this stay to anyone."
1040,868295,2021-11-06,"This was a GREAT find for anyone wanting to visit the city one a budget. Communication was great, its the first door on the second floor in an area convenient to the train. There were absolutely no bugs that I encountered. <br/><br/>My only minor concerns was the mold in the shower- it wasn’t a little it was a lot. Also the door to my room was not able to be locked. You could lock it being in the room but it is laughable how easy it was to unlock it from the other side. Also it seemed the door to the apartment was never locked. <br/><br/>All in all this was a good place to crash for a few days!"
1041,635982,2020-07-07,William’s Place was amazing! The location is right next to the L train and there are a lot of neat little eateries near. I had plans to go different places but I mostly ended up staying in because this room was so comfy and cozy. I am planning on staying here again when I come in town in August.

1043,177991,2021-02-07,Beautiful apartment. Exactly as the pictures describe. 10/10 <3
1044,503584,2019-12-09,Very nice place to stay in BedStuy. The place is huge! Way more than I expected for space. Recommend all around.
1045,709467,2020-05-28,Loved it. Was better than the pictures look online and huge!
1046,714484,2019-12-30,"Mon copain et moi même sommes venues passer une semaine dans ce logement, pour Noël <br/><br/>L’arrivée autonome est agréable surtout quand on ne sait pas vraiment à quelle heure on vas arriver. <br/><br/>Le seul point négatif est en effet l’ambiance bruyante du au bar juste en dessous, cela dit aucunes surprises car nous étions prévenus et de plus ni mon copain ni moi même avons été gêné pour dormir.<br/>Car soyons clair après une journée entière de visite de New York la fatigue se fait sentir. De plus la literie est plus que confortable !<br/><br/>Jason a su être très rapidement réactif à nos moindres messages et questions, c’est très agréable<br/><br/>Le gros point positif de ce logement reste l’emplacement : <br/>- 3m d’une bouche de métro (ligne L) qui vous amène en 15mins sur Manhattan, c’est vraiment super ! <br/><br/>Au delà du métro, le quartier est vraiment   Top :  <br/><br/>- de la pizzeria en face dans la rue au restaurant Thaï dans la rue adjacente..<br/>Il y a même une supérette ouvert 24/24<br/><br/>Je recommande vraiment, car à ce prix là c’est vraiment exceptionnel! <br/><br/>Merci encore à Jason, Austin et Riza de nous avoir permis de réaliser notre rêve : Passer noël à NY sans se ruiner avec le budget logement !

1047,291529,2019-08-12,"The appartment is very spacious and in a good neighbourhood. <br/>We are a family of 5 and loved the appartment very much. The subway is nearby (10 min walk) and in about 20-30 min you‘re in Manhattan. <br/>The kitchen is well-equipped. The knobs in the shower didn‘t work at first, but Elissa sent someone over to fix it the same day. She‘s a very nice host and responds quickly. <br/>Thank you for your hospitality. <br/>Greetings, <br/>Toni and his family"
1048,794001,2021-02-12,I've stayed at Fazias place two times. The place is very clean and he's on point with everything
1049,775820,2019-11-12,"Great space, close to tourist activities, and accommodating.  Communicated really well and quickly."
1050,587793,2019-12-15,"This place was great and Sush was an awesome host! If you are looking for a place close to columbia in the upper west side, this is perfect!"
1051,686462,2021-04-27,"Location, location, location. This apartment is beautifully decorated, the building itself is very nice. We stayed a month here and wish we could stay forever. Roughly 3 doors down from the Dakota, less than a block to be in Central Park. Couldn’t recommend enough!"
1052,687769,2019-05-27,Samantha’s place is an amazing location and safe for those with any concerns. The hospitality and amenities were everything you need and more! Definitely recommend to anyone!
1053,355022,2019-01-28,Clean and conveniently located studio. Easy communication with the host.
1054,641787,2021-10-24,"Such a cozy and private spot. We only stayed for one night, but it was a really nice and safe area to stay. The room is super cozy and comfortable! Very walkable and close to the train."
1055,806974,2021-07-22,"Great neighborhood, super quiet and full of local gems. The space is ample, enough to put my daughter to sleep in the top bunk, and not wake her up from the kitchen area. Mathieu is a super host, accommodating and helpful. Subways lines well connected to Manhattan and trendy parts of Brooklyn."
1056,723937,2021-02-28,"Super friendly hosts, many restaurants and stores around to check out. Also easy to catch the subway from. Would definitely stay there again!"
1057,721061,2019-04-24,Enjoyed my stay. Great location. Barbershops are open late for those night owls. Safe area. Right around the corner from subway. I’d stay again.
1058,477176,2019-08-13,We have really enjoyed our stay with Sara!!<br/>She gave us great tips where to and how to get there.<br/>Everyone was very nice and welcoming (the dogs as well).
1059,527610,2019-07-04,Great place!
1060,551270,2019-10-24,"Flat bigger than expected, and very convenient. It is 10 min Walk to métro station and not far from East river ferry+ next to williamsburg trendy center. Ismael has been very reactive  to all my questions and very helpful. I do recommend!"
1061,754580,2020-06-15,Nice place
1062,219778,2019-01-03,El contacto con Carly lo hace todo más fácil.
1063,542402,2019-01-02,Jeremys house is a great place to explore New York. The house is very stylish and comfortable. You can take a metro to Manhattan within 15 minutes by foot.
1064,635912,2019-01-15,"Great place. Convenient location by the station. Thorough check-in instructions, be sure to read carefully or can be a bit difficult to get in."
1065,577317,2021-06-07,"Room was clean and basic. Apartment was easy to check in, decent location with access into Brooklyn and Manhattan. Unfortunately, my first night in the place, it was very loud with live music playing in the back of the apartment nearby until 1AM. It didn’t happen the second night, so I’m not sure if it was an isolated incident. There did not seem to be any bars or venues in that area."
1066,214141,2019-07-07,Great place to crash overnight when traveling.
1067,46336,2019-05-07,Great location and an awesome host!
1068,463881,2019-03-26,"Greg’s place is located in a very lovely neighbourhood and very comfortable! There was nothing to complain about, we enjoyed our stay immensely"
1069,776555,2019-10-18,Nice place to stay I would definitely book again
1070,513295,2021-11-17,Great place nice and cozy
1071,559334,2020-01-04,"Edgar has been by far the best host we've ever had in AirBnB. The apartment was great, the location perfect, close to the metro and Central Park, everything very clean and with all we needed and more. All these made our experience even better. We will always recommend his apartment for New York."
1072,487485,2019-09-08,Very affordable and great location.
1073,826208,2021-03-11,Great space and location. Enjoyed our time here and will definitely go back if we can.
1074,167696,2020-02-17,Hospitality was amazing. Very friendly and welcoming.  Responds in a timely manner. Would recommend this stay.
1075,823239,2020-09-11,"Very nice apartment, would recommend."
1076,783983,2019-11-30,Great stay!
1077,823849,2021-09-09,"I had a great experience at Roxanas place!  Roxana is very kind, extremely responsive, and made sure I was comfortable. <br/><br/>The location is very convenient - nice bars and restaurants locally but easy to get into Manhattan.  The apartment is clean and has a lot of space - as seen in the pictures.<br/><br/>One thing to note is that there is street noise and I would suggest ear plugs which can help. <br/><br/>Great place to stay for short or longer term."
1078,242272,2019-04-09,"This was my first ever airbnb experience and it turned out amazing and even more than I expected. Not only did I stay in a building and apartment with character, to experience real Brooklyn life, but my hostess Marilyn was a famous calypso singer (""back in the day""!). So the bonus was that I have stayed with a Caribbean super-star! <br/>Really comfy bed, crisp bed linen, fluffy white towels, good size fridge, super clean bathroom next door and the whole apartment has a relaxing feel with low lighting and a radio station quietly playing in the background. Woken up by birds singing in the tree outside the window. It really is a Cozy Corner in every sense.<br/>But all credit has to go to my host who was gracious and welcoming (when I arrived late at 02:15), friendly, charming, always had time for a chat in the evenings, and had the best smile ever! The location is absolutely superb and an easy journey to/from Newark airport with just a one-block walk from New York Penn Station to the Q-train at 34th Street/Herald Square. In two days I explored many parts of Manhattan as well as Coney Island, Brighton Beach and Prospect Park.  I cannot imagine wanting to stay anywhere else if I visit NYC again and I fully agree with all other previous positive reviews. Thank you so much, Marilyn, you are the best!"
1079,794736,2020-03-07,"Mycket bra centralt boende, bra service och snabb återkoppling då vi hade frågor, rekommenderas varmt!"
1080,743847,2019-12-01,"Enjoyed staying in this cool location, someplace I wouldn't have found on my own.  It was an opportunity to stay in a brownstone, with nearby subway access and walkable to the northern part of Central Park.  The host was flexible on my later arrival.  A small hot water machine and microwave set up allowed me to make a couple simple meals on my own.  The host was super quick on responding to communications and made sure I could find the place and get in.  I would certainly stay again."
1081,852609,2021-05-03,This place is quite unique. My family was veryComfortable here. The host was super responsive and anytime we texted him about anything he immediately got back to us. The location is great you’re close to the park and a short walk to lots of restaurants and the train. Definitely a basement New York apartment but it’s good if you’re looking for a quiet place to stay. Also quite spacious. 10 out of 10
1082,883089,2021-10-31,"My boyfriend and I stayed here for a month in between long-term apartment leases here in the city. The apartment has been great -- clean, spacious, cozy, and an easy location from multiple subways. I worked from home 3-4 days a week and had no issues doing so. The apartment is close to Central Park so I was also able to jog in the park on the weekends. Harton, Oliver, and the rest of the team were proactive and easy to communicate with. Would highly recommend!!"
1083,462267,2021-08-15,The house is clean and spacious. Did not expect toys from house since we have kid traveling with us but Nic provided toys for our kid. We love the house its really beautiful. <br/>Thank you  so much
1084,625079,2020-03-11,"I needed a simple one-night stay in Manhattan for a concert.  This place exceeded all my needs.  There are not many listings for place with a private bath at this price point, which made for great value for accommodations.  The private room was tidy, clean, and quiet, period, not just quiet by NYC standards.  Check in and out was easy and painless, and hosts were extremely prompt with communication."
1085,871372,2021-08-27,"The hosts are lovely, they made me (young woman traveling alone) very safe. Their home and the room was beautiful, I wanted to ask where they got absolutely everything. They were extremely accommodating when it came to delays in flights, or needing change check in/out time (fast responders). Overall, amazing stay, I showed it off to everyone!"
1086,814003,2021-02-20,Good
1087,772716,2021-11-21,You cannot beat the location of this home. Easy to get to almost anywhere in New York! The beds are also super comfortable and the bedrooms are quite sizable. Nis was also super responsive with check-in and checkout being super easy. It had all the necessities we needed.
1088,798659,2020-06-28,Great place to stay for vacation. Nice and relaxing.
1089,455444,2021-06-09,Great place! Very clean and organized. Host was great and attentive. Neighborhood was very convenient for many things. Hope to return back.
1090,703891,2021-02-23,"Great place to stay, nice cozy apartment. Amazing neighborhood with great restaurants. The apartment was clean and very convenient for a several week stay while I worked in the area."
1091,758956,2021-08-05,"I stayed here for a month with 2 friends. There was enough space for us and it was at a very convenient location, nearby a subway station and restaurants. The in unit washer and dryer and dishwasher were a game changer! The Airbnb didn’t provide us with a lot of household items that would’ve been helpful for our long stay: water filter, soap, toilet paper, trash bags, toilet cleaner, and swifter sheets (to name a few). We ended up having to buy them ourselves. Response times were also a bit long, but Ross was very nice and accommodating when I talked to him. Overall we had a very good time and would definitely come back to this place again!"
1092,654978,2021-07-31,"Great location, hosts are so knowledgeable about the area, and getting to Manhattan is so easy. Great place to stay at especially if you want to be nearby a lot of good and affordable restaurants."
1093,735506,2020-12-20,"Cute small place perfect for short stays and at great value. The place is very small, and behind a house on a quiet street, but everything you might need is there. For sure suited best for minimalists. There are definitely some areas for improvement - The WiFi is extremely slow and keeps disconnecting, it made it extremely hard to work and I often had to use LTE instead. Sometimes the lights kept flickering, and only a bed sheet and a thin blanket was provided. I suggest to please fix the WiFi and lights and to provide a comforter or a thicker blanket for a more comfortable night sleep."
1094,283939,2019-12-26,Clean and quite space. Easy to get on bus to Flushing. Quick respond.
1095,845488,2021-06-09,Great Stay I highly recommend it
1096,807640,2021-02-14,Great location and hosts
1097,233330,2020-10-26,"Absolutely loved our stay! Dominik's apartment is very clean and thoughtfully designed. Loved chatting with Dominik and getting to know Lula! Amazing location, close to subway and surrounded by great food. Would definitely stay again :)"
1098,70499,2019-08-27,Maurice provides excellent communication and is very helpful in recommendations for things to do in the neighbourhood. The apartment has maintained a historic ambiance with modern conveniences.
1099,731758,2019-05-12,"Liz was very well organized with the logistical arrangements and check-in information. All queries were promptly answered/addressed. The apartment was perfect for my needs and very conveniently located, near the express subway green line, and UES restaurants, Met, CP, etc.  Highly recommend, I would definitely go back."
1100,829760,2021-07-24,Everything was perfect! The apartment is beautiful and exactly as pictured.
1101,469336,2021-11-16,"Great apartment. Clean, quiet, everything we needed. Excellent host. Prompt communication, very accommodating. The best place and location we’ve ever stayed in the city. So many great restaurants and shops that we didn’t feel the need to venture far, but when we did it was easy to do with the subway so close by. Highly recommended! We would stay there again."
1102,372355,2019-06-01,Jamie's place is great for a solid traveler or a couple. Very friendly cat and nice space. One of my favorite areas in NYC to visit.
1103,502223,2019-11-03,"This was a really great experience: clean, nice, short walk to the train station and with the host above very convenient."
1104,623211,2021-01-30,Amazing spot. Very true to pictures and the home owners are the kindest people. Raissa made sure I was comfortable for my whole stay from beginning to end. Bed is comfortable and the space is perfect
1105,622943,2021-03-12,Hyacinth's place is one of the best on Airbnb. her and her son are accommodating and takes very good care of you. her place is very clean and well-kept.
1106,830089,2021-07-18,Erika & Brett are amazing hosts and their house in spectacular! We loved it so much that we extended our stay and now we’re sad to leave.
1107,611286,2021-09-16,"I absolutely love Aleksandra and her cutie son. I felt at home instantaneously. It was so easy to pop in for work with everything so easy. Very clean with all the extras you could possibly need. Also, the reviews of the bed and I’ll add pillows were spot on - more comfortable than my bed! Can’t wait to come back! Thank you Aleksandra!"
1108,88014,2020-03-23,"Raj was really an awesome host, location is perfect and the apartment is really nice (liked the tech stuff you put in there, that makes it really nice). Our trip unfortunately had to end earlier because of the pandemic, but Raj really made everything he could to make us as comfortable as we could be in that situation, helping a lot through checkin, the actual stay and even the very troubled checkout (troubled because it was a last minute decision to go back home)"
1109,484505,2019-09-04,New York apartments are very small. So when I saw that this had a private room I made the choice to stay here. Eric's family was very helpful from the start. They communicated with me during this whole trip to make sure everything was great. Even little small details like leaving an umbrella made all the difference. The location is great. I felt very safe walking around area and I was close to public transportation.
1110,773281,2019-10-05,The location is great. The room in nice enough if you are going by yourself for a quick trip.<br/>the only thing I did not like was they provide only one small skinny towel for who requires 4 days minimum stay
1111,663584,2019-05-19,We had a wonderful and comfortable stay here! Everything was very stylish and clean. The 3 train is also super close.
1112,601230,2019-02-10,在曼哈顿找到这样的房子挺棒的。Peiyi热情开朗，及时回复客人的问题，并竭尽所能提供帮助，房间非常适合家庭出游，尤其是喜欢自己烹饪的客人，厨房用具一应俱全。交通方便，楼下的M1公交车可以带你到第五大街你感兴趣的任何地方，是大家出游选择的好地方!
1113,335547,2021-02-15,Amazing place .. With a affordable price !
1114,787798,2020-08-18,My SO and I enjoyed ourselves
1115,705505,2019-11-01,"Julia's place was great. Conveniently located and in a wonderful area of Williamsburg. The apartment is clean and comfy for two + people. It's also HUGE by NY standards. One of the beds is on the harder side and one is on the softer side, so you'll have your pick. The building is an older factory/loft style building but it's kept up really nicely. There was a band practicing next door, but they didn't go late at all. It is on the ground floor, but the block is fairly quiet and you can't see in through the windows. Overall, a great BK Airbnb experience :)"
1116,778414,2021-11-09,"Great room, very clean"
1117,737523,2020-02-02,"Great location, trains near by, shopping and many choices of food."
1118,880764,2021-09-26,"Great value and dog friendly. How is very responsive. The apartment is located in a great neighborhood, but be prepared for some nearby street noise at night. The apartment has a lived in feel, but was comfortable and clean."
1119,871119,2021-08-30,"One of my favorite stays so far!☺️<br/><br/>I arrived a bit frazzled after a hectic day & happened to run into Alina and her family on my way in. They were very welcoming which helped put me at ease. I mostly keep to myself, but they were easy to get in touch with throughout my stay <br/><br/>As for the place: it's clean and spacious. There's a washer & dryer, a great shower, and a beautiful backyard garden. Plus, it's just a stone's throw away from Astoria Park <br/><br/>Definitely recommend for anyone who's looking for a quiet but well-located stay!"
1120,117725,2019-05-26,Great price & great location. Super close to the Subway. Beatrix was quick to respond.
1121,856286,2021-11-07,"Luci & Jacob was great in communication and the value of their host location was a plus… they are very helpful in tips and any other information about the city, definitely there is a need of improvement on the cleaning service and more accurate information on the location of the key box,  besides that the overhaul was great experience… tip for the future guests on the corner of the 128th street there are a deli that serves an awesome sub… “Eleganza Gourmet” :P"
1122,857471,2021-04-28,"Firstly I would like to emphasize that I will never return because of multiple reasons. The host was not accessible, when I called her, she did not answer. Furthermore, she took hours to respond to questions and concerns when I texted her. All throughout my stay, she maintained a nonchalant attitude, which is something I’ve never experienced with any host in my past Airbnb experiences. Moreover, the living conditions were not up to par with Airbnb standards. There was no hot water in the bathroom. Initially I shared the bathroom and the living room area with another guest for almost a week, the host came in not once to check if the living area or the bathroom was clean, I had to reach out to the host to please clean the bathroom and I got the idea that she was thinking I should clean it, however she came and cleaned it but that was the only time that bathroom was ever cleaned by the host for my entire three weeks at the space. She never once checked on us to see if we’re out of toiletries, paper towel or towels. Once I asked for an additional paper towel and her response is “what are we doing with the paper towel?” She’s implying we’re wasting it, I guess. The host allowed the other guest to accommodate her two dogs, and I witnessed one of the dogs pee on the floor in the living area. Lastly, the neighborhood is atrocious if you wish to work remotely or live in peace, this is not the place. I was working remotely and it was very terrible, the neighbors played loud, obnoxious music almost every night, which kept me awake throughout the night. I brought this to the host attention because I was literally trying to sleep for work at 6am but the noise was too loud. When I told her about the loud music and my inability to sleep, her response was this is NYC, she can’t do anything. Once again I would not recommend this place to anyone. Until the host improves, I don’t think this space should even be on Airbnb."
1123,871780,2021-09-25,It is a beautiful and super complete apartment!<br/>Your hosts are super friendly and understanding! Thank you!<br/>I super recommend them
1124,703998,2021-04-18,Perfect staycation
1125,434532,2019-02-17,Mariam’s place is  so cozy and thoughtful. Very spacious (surprisingly way bigger than we thought ); everything is there to feel comfort and have a great rest in the evening .Mattress is amazingly amazing  .. Mariam is sweet and caring . She was very kind and understanding letting us to check  out an hour later .. great experience overall
1126,878038,2021-10-11,Very clean just like it's described. Would definitely stay there again.
1127,835194,2021-05-17,Great place with chill vibes. Would come back.
1128,700058,2021-05-19,"The hosts were super nice! They have a really sweet pup, which I wasn't expecting but was a fun surprise. The internet was down for one day, which was inconvenient, but they did everything they could to get it back up and running as quick as they could, so I really appreciated that. The space is small but a GREAT location."
1129,534376,2019-11-19,"Adeyemi's place is worth the money if you concern about safety, cleanliness and hospitality. I would recommend his place to everyone I know. I definitely would go there again.  See you soon."
1130,663267,2020-02-15,"Would highly recommend Miao’s spot for anyone looking to explore Brooklyn and have quick, easy access into Manhattan!<br/><br/>What a great spot to be! Close to transit, tasty food, and an excellent coffee shop on the corner. <br/><br/>Miao’s place was exceptionally clean, tidy, and well organized. We especially enjoyed the artwork around the house and the accessibility to the city as well as Miao’s recommendations for food, coffee, and bars around Brooklyn. <br/><br/>Would stay here again!"
1131,501889,2019-06-01,"I would not hesitate to recommend Hanna's place to any one looking for a nice, comfortable and convenient place to stay in Queens. Hanna is a great host."
1132,849377,2021-02-14,This place is a scam. I was there for less than 9 hours total and my privacy was invaded. This host went into my room when I wasn’t there. Then went ahead and blamed me for his already dirty bathroom and said I was smoking when it was actually him inside his room. Had me waiting outside in the cold until he finished his online game. The worst experience I’ve ever had with an Airbnb host. Do not recommend at all
1133,426468,2019-01-19,"Jenny’s place was very accommodating. I had lots of privacy, ample space to put my belongings, and was able to use the washer/dryer. Very welcoming and I would have stayed longer if I could have.<br/>Also, the apartment’s water pressure in the shower is incredible.... just saying."
1134,773706,2021-11-24,"I booked this for my parents for their recent visit, as I live a block away and it was an ideal location for us. Darrell and Miki were so welcoming and accommodating from our arrival. The apartment is incredibly spacious, clean, and thoughtfully set up. The only downside to note is the lack of a kitchen, which was not a problem for my parents at all, as they were mostly eating out or ordering takeout."
1135,91677,2019-09-19,El lugar no es para poder habitarla. Muchas cucarachas por todos lados. Suena el piso es de madera todo . No hay desayunos así lo pidan. Debe uno reclamarlo y dan limitado.
1136,665378,2019-04-10,"The apartment has a great location, near subway. Good price. Everything was good and Elif responded very quick all the messages."
1137,883441,2021-11-28,Nice compact room in a facility currently being renovated. Friendly and helpful staff. Would stay here again.
1138,891832,2021-11-28,A.J.’s place in Brooklyn was a fantastic stay! The apartment is in a great location in Brooklyn and is a quick ride to manhattan. The apartment it’s self is very comfortable and well designed and decorated. Definitely would recommend to a friend and would also stay there again!
1139,392717,2021-01-29,"Great value for a spacious two bedroom apartment in a prime Williamsburg location. It is directly across from subway and street-facing, so it is loud, which we knew about prior to booking. Ear plugs are provided though!"

1146,563533,2019-02-03,"Bryan's place was incredible! From the location to the decor, it made my Brooklyn experience even better than I anticipated.  Byan was an excellent host as well. He was quick to respond to any questions I had during my stay and left a thoughtful list of local restaurants, coffee shops, and bars. I would love to stay here again in the future."
1147,25399,2019-11-21,"Nice apartment near the metro and near Central Park about 10 mint. The owners are very nice and they let us stay longer the day we have to leave to the airport we really appreciate that. Nice neighbor hood, supermarket and restaurants near by. Good place to stay around Harlem area."
1148,783686,2021-06-07,Great Hosts! great location as well. I was here on business and they were extremely accommodating and flexible. Spacious apartment and lots of food close by on Merrick Blvd. They are great hosts because they give you privacy and. Still check to make sure your not in need of anything. We stayed for 2 months and had a great stay.
1149,397447,2019-05-28,"Ainslie et John réagissent très vite à chaque message. Nous sommes arrivés tard le soir et malgré ça, ils nous ont très bien accueillis !!! Possibilité de mettre des denrées alimentaires dans le frigo. Quartier calme et agréable,  ils nous ont toujours donné de très bons conseils et ils sont très sympathiques. Un petit plus : John parle bien le français. <br/>J’espère y revenir un jour."

1151,640151,2019-04-04,Johns place is a great place to stay if your looking for easy access to the subway and many places close to eat. John was a great host and responded quickly to all my questions. Simple affordable place to stay at with a comfy bed! Would love to stay here again.

1155,733578,2021-04-07,AMAZING !!
1156,2164,2020-07-20,"I’ve been to a lot of Airbnb’s in Brooklyn, but this is by far one of my favorites.  The place is clean and very very cozy.  If you sit down to watch tv you might just wind up napping.  The place is amazing, from decor to patio, to the way everything has been arranged.  Even the old style bathroom was cool.  If it wasn’t for Covid there’d be a lot of bars open nearby.  Still, a great experience if you want to stay in."
1157,720907,2019-12-08,Very warm and inviting. From the decor to the amenities everything was carefully picked out and made the space feel like home
1158,660110,2021-03-26,"This is a great place to stay if you need somewhere to lay your head. Kind people, responsive & comfy room. Their dog, Mr. Manhattan will also make you feel at home ❤️"

1160,682464,2020-04-01,Perfect<br/>Will return again
1161,732360,2019-05-30,"Jk and his sister were very friendly and responsive. I do have a couple of suggestions/thoughts:<br/>1. It would be nice to get a complete set of towels (bath, hand and washcloth). Women might want a second towel for their hair ( which JK provided when asked).  Thanks!!<br/>2. The air conditioner was a big plus!!<br/>3. I bought grapefruit to eat for breakfast and I couldn’t find a bowl or plate anywhere in the kitchen. It was too early to ask anyone and I wasn’t sure anyone was home at that point. I ate my grapefruit out of the frying pan sitting on top of the stove.<br/>4. The location to the cathedral of St. John the Divine ( across the street), the people’s garden (same block), Morningside Park (down the hill) and my daughter’s apartment was perfect! All within walking distance. Couldn’t have asked for a better location. Train was nearby, too!<br/>5. My biggest criticism was the mattress. It was so lumpy and uncomfortable. It sits in a wooden box. You can’t sit on the side of the bed without sitting on the wood side. A new, firmer mattress would be a big plus!!<br/>6. The bedroom has a good sized closet ( needs more than 2 hangers), a nice desk and chair and plenty of outlets for recharging, etc.<br/>7. I would definitely stay here again, especially if they got a new mattress!!<br/>       Thanks, JK!!"
1162,872121,2021-06-13,"This place was perfect. Beautiful and quiet neighborhood, very nice sitting area just outside your door, very comfortable bed, and the art in the room was an awesome touch. It was exactly what we needed after long days in the city."
1163,838444,2021-05-07,"Great place to stay. Very convenient if you’re looking for something near RUMC. <br/>The apartment is super clean, check in process is seamless, parking is very convenient in the drive way. Communication with the host was super easy. <br/>Truly a great stay. No complaints what-so-ever."
1164,479166,2019-03-10,"C’est notre second séjour chez Olzhas et Anna et nous comptons revenir ! De super hôtes ! Ils sont très sympathique et réactif. L’appartement est très propre, silencieux et proche des transports. Nous avons adoré notre séjour et espérons revenir au plus vite ! Olzhas et Anna sont de superbes personnes."
1165,65007,2020-02-07,Nice apartment. Beautiful neighborhood.
1166,613490,2019-09-19,Barrio tranquilo con restaurantes y tiendas cerca. Alojamiento acogedor.
1167,448094,2020-10-09,"Surrounded by a lot of restaurants and bars, The location is great. There are six other rooms, so you might be sharing the apartment with difficult personalities or get lucky and barely see any of them. I had a rough first couple of days with one of the other occupants of the place, but Suzette was very responsive to the situation and took care of it."
1168,890755,2021-10-25,"Check In: 10/10 ⭐️ super smooth, Ivan was a very fast responder and greeted my friend and I very excited for us to stay :) the check in process was very smooth and we had no doubt about enjoying our stay. <br/><br/>Communication: Even before booking this listing I got in contact with Ivan with some questions and he answered almost immediately with great detail which was amazing and left no room for confusion. <br/><br/>Accuracy: The pictures on the listing show exactly how it was. However, I was the first person to stay and in a conversation with the hosts, they mentioned all the upgrades they will be making! Everything sounded amazing  so I’m sure updated pictures will come soon. <br/><br/>Location: Right in Harlem and only a couple of blocks from the nearest access to subway. Around the corner there are several deli’s, pharmacy, and a laundromat plus a lot more, Including food options. It was our first time going to NYC and the use of (Hidden by Airbnb) maps is crucial! However, we had fun navigating and finding our way throughout the state of NY and ending our long days back at the Airbnb. <br/><br/>Value: 10/10 ⭐️ the value is amazing for how much it cost and I am so grateful for that! My friend and I are both college students so we had a budget. Staying here felt like we were staying with family and we always felt comfortable with Ivan, Marcia, and other guests. They were so inviting and always held great conversation. We will be back for sure :)"
1169,860915,2021-09-23,This was a super cute place and had great amenities. We had a great time and would highly recommend it to anyone!
1170,764024,2020-07-14,"There’s a camera in the property that’s in the kitchen facing the bathroom ( not in the living room as noted on the reservation) I was traveling with female friends so I covered the camera. I didn’t think it would be a problem since there’s another camera outdoors & I honestly did not think it would be on. The host contacted me an hour later and ask me to uncover it. I communicated that my guest and I were uncomfortable due to it’s location but he insisted on the covering being removed.  We decided to leave after that - it was becoming a creepy experience for us all, it was very uncomfortable. If you’re a female traveling with friends and or alone, I would not recommend this place. #PeepingTom"
1171,791810,2021-04-19,Perfect location in Brooklyn! I would recommend staying at Kamil's place to other travelers :)
1172,768528,2021-01-19,"nice place, 2 floors, needa a newer kitchen but very comfortable"
1173,834975,2021-10-01,"We had an awesome, comfortable stay at Hector and Clarissa's place. It was in a very convenient location within a few minute walk to multiple metro stations, restaurants/cafes, and a climbing gym (!!!). We were able to check out the different boroughs of NYC with ease. Hector was always super responsive and friendly, and gave us a ton of great resources on things to do and see. Would definitely recommend."
1174,700175,2019-05-31,"Great place, awesome location!"

1178,860512,2021-05-31,"For what it is, it is great place to stay if you just need a place to sleep and you plan to go out most of the time. The room is kind of small, the bathroom tiny. The bed is phenomenal, especially after a long day walking."

1185,271728,2019-12-09,"I booked a small room just to spend the night. Brady's place was more than I expected, having a cosy shared living room with a kitchen, providing a good place to relax and do some work or reading. The place was very welcoming, and decorated with a nice personal touch. The street was nice and quiet, and the J-train station nearby. Definitely a good choice when you visit NYC, and want a place where you can relax a bit after an intensive day."
1186,869875,2021-07-03,"This place managed to please my big, disfunctional family. Everybody had their space and privacy while being all together. With a big group we appreciated that we didn’t need cars to get around. We could walk everywhere. We discovered the river park which we didn’t know before. The space is clean and open. Thank you so much"
1187,672091,2020-01-02,Great place
1188,614180,2019-11-04,Great host and great space. Right across the street from the SI Railway which makes getting to Manhattan easy. I stayed here for the NY Marathon and it only took 20 mins from the time I left to the time I was inside the runner's village.
1189,637552,2019-02-21,"Such a beautiful and comfy place to stay. I highly recommend and must say that the amenities and cleanliness are amazing. <br/>5 min walking from metro, near many stores and good neighborhood. <br/>Great check-in and check-out experience. <br/>Host is a very hospitable person, indicates good places both to eat and hang out. <br/>Have fun!"

1202,643607,2019-11-15,"I had an excellent stay at Vanessa's place. She was easy to communicate with and very friendly and helpful. The place was spotless and it was easily one of the most comfortable beds I've ever slept in. The location is perfect, right across the street from Riverside Park and in a very cool neighborhood (my favorite spot in the city). I plan to check this place first whenever I visit in the future, as I would love to stay here again. Thank you for everything, Vanessa!"
1203,475293,2021-06-14,Great view from bedroom! Alittle dusty in the room but there is a private lock and easy check in. Russell was responsive and accommodating
1204,631972,2019-04-08,"located in Brooklyn and the place is a lot nicer than expected! the rooms are exactly as pictured! the only thing was, since it is in the basement floor, we heard water running through the pipes or something throughout the night and you can also hear when there are people walking upstairs. my bf and i stayed in the room with the washing machine so i'm not sure if the other bedroom can hear the same thing. not complaining, just letting people know! the bathroom is very clean and equipped with enough towels for everyone! the bedrooms are clean as well! Nuno and his gf are super friendly! they had to attend an event that weekend so we did hear a lot of walking around upstairs early morning around 6-7am as they were preparing upstairs but totally understandable. Nuno is also an amazing chef so if you have time, you should visit his restaurant for yummy food! :) we wish we had the chance to do that! Nuno is very responsive and won't keep you waiting more than a day! if you're staying in Brooklyn, this location is a short distance away from buses and walking distance to nearby markets & eateries."
1205,885861,2021-11-08,Place was just as advertised. Clean comfortable and pretty accessible to transportation. Some affordable restaurants in that area was a plus

1211,400828,2019-03-03,Carmen & Fernando were the most gracious hosts I've encountered. They went above and beyond to ensure that I had everything that I needed and their place was amazing. It was easy to access and as hosts they are close enough to tend to any needs that you may have. They provided every amenity. I highly recommend their place
1212,879845,2021-10-27,"Un departamento muy bien ubicado, con varias estaciones de metro cercanas, atracciones y restaurantes, muy limpio, con a/a y calefacción, wifi, etc. , Nuestra estancia en New York fue muy agradable"
1213,459855,2019-09-15,Very convenient and cozy! I stayed here for a one month rotation at Weiler Hospital and it was perfectly within walking distance. Has all the amenities you would need for a short or long stay. Grocery store is right next to the building and laundromat is close by as well.  I would recommend staying here! Pietro is a great host who makes sure you are doing okay and is quick to respond to any questions.

1220,760395,2019-12-02,"We had a great stay and would absolutely recommend Juan Pablo and Yvette's space.  The apartment has great energy - plants, special rocks and musical instruments abound.  We had everything we needed to enjoy cozy time in the space, walk to Brooklyn neighborhood adventures, or hop on the very nearby L train for access to Manhattan, Williamsburg, and Bushwick.   We adopted Charter Coffeehouse on Graham Ave as our morning coffee spot for the long weekend. <br/><br/>Super comfortable bed.  As a former Brooklynite returning for a visit I felt welcomed and at home - Juan Pablo and Yvette's space was everything we hoped!"
1221,769306,2021-07-09,Okay for the price.

1230,749256,2021-03-16,the place was extremely clean and I enjoyed it verymuch
1231,360787,2021-08-25,"Unfortunately even if the Boat looks really amazing and as a experience is really cool, Ben’s boat is way too old and deteriorated for the high price. As host he is really nice and was incredible attentive to us but the place didn’t meet our expectations. The AC was barely working and we went on a 90 degrees day. The bathroom downstairs didn’t have a door and the one upstairs was not clean. Also the furniture in the terrace was almost broke and we were not able to sit and stayed there for a long time. The AC at the room was all dirty and it took more than 5 hours to cool down the room. Really sad experience."
1232,820527,2021-11-22,Great value for the money!
1233,731203,2020-11-10,Great host
1234,425099,2019-11-12,"If you’re looking for a place to visit the city this is a top choice. It is very affordable comparing to all the other prices and areas, just one (free) ferry ride away. This place is spotless, they also provide so many amenities from snacks, shampoo/conditioner, food menus and a home away from home! Definitely would stay here again, and their hospitality was AMAZING."
1235,460358,2019-11-10,Все было отлично! Очень чисто и уютно. Отдельный вход от хозяев прибавлял приватности. Сдаются две комнаты с одной общей кухней и санузлом. До метро 10 минут неспешным шагом. Район безопасный. Рядом есть много кафе и магазинов
1236,882113,2021-10-26,Amazing host and place to stay - 100% would stay again when I'm in NY!
1237,448674,2019-04-16,"Just like in the description. Overall it was really nice, just the one towel had a hole in it and there were just 2 rolls of toilet paper for 4 rooms and no additional to find. But other than that it was great."
1238,869493,2021-05-31,"The place was great! Definitely larger than I expected and the beds are super comfortable! Sergo was great, I’m sure we got on his nerve but he kept a smile on his face!! He was attentive if we needed anything!"
1239,770520,2021-11-15,Great location! You can go anywhere from the 36 AV subway station. Clean and confortable for 5 or 6 people. Silent neighborhood and close to food and pharmacy stores. Daniel communication was good and check in was pretty easy.
1240,227434,2019-05-12,Jesse‘s place was really nice and clean and we found everything we needed there! It was almost like staying in a hotel plus having a kitchen and living room. Jesse was available at all time and was really helpful as we had a problem. <br/>Subway stations (we recommend 35th Street station instead of 25th) and supermarkets are reachable within few minutes walking distance.<br/>We were four girls and we can only  recommend staying in this place. You can clearly see that Jesse is a host with heart and soul!

1242,752792,2019-07-26,할렘지엵이랅 초큼 불않하긴 하쥐만 생갉보다 괙찮. 그럻나 집은 살짥 덝러움
1243,714300,2021-10-03,"Good Morning,<br/><br/>This is Rashida Siyar, who rented your AirB&B through my niece Farheen Hussain. Following is the experience we had in the accommodation mentioned above:<br/><br/>At the outset, I want to Thank You Sergo for his services. However, the AirB&B itself was not all in order. Here are some of the the difficulties we faced at the place:<br/><br/>When we arrived, at our scheduled time on October 1st, we were unpleasantly surprised that we had to go to the 4th floor (no elevator) with our luggage. Please be mindful, out of four people two of us are close to the age of 70 and my husband, Farrukh Siyar is 73 year old & my sister & I have knee problems. <br/><br/>At the time of my booking this place there was no mention of any apartment or it being on the fourth floor. It was advertised just as a big home with two bedrooms. However, after reaching the fourth floor we called Sergo & he shifted us to the 2nd floor.  Then we found out that the hot water faucet in the bathroom sink was not working. We had to use the tub faucet whenever we went to the bathroom. There was no shampoo or toothpaste or other toiletries. If it was clearly written that these basic items were not provided, we would have brought them on our own. Sergo got us shampoo. But for the toothpaste my sister & I had to go out at about 10:30pm to look for  a store to buy the toothpaste. Finally we found a store & got toothpaste but not before avoiding more than a couple of drunks on the road. Even the comforters were not of standard quality. <br/><br/>In a  nutshell, the rent we paid for the above accommodation was much more than it was worth. In view of the above explanation, I submit this claim to return half of my payment  (about $450) which would be a fair deal. <br/><br/>I will be looking forward & would appreciate a favorable reply from you.<br/><br/>Thank You,<br/>Rashida Siyar"
1244,650726,2019-07-27,Kaz was a wonderful host - he was responsive to any questions and the place was lovely.  Would highly recommend!
1245,420493,2019-02-25,Andrew is a wonderful host and the property is everything as described and more. My expectations were more than exceeded. Super great location....1 minute walk to a number of subway lines....walking distance to anything you need in Park Slope. I would recommend highly!!

1263,831236,2021-08-02,This place is awesome. Great value especially if you’re going to a Mets game or a show at forest hills. Dunkin’ Donuts and a liquor store at the end of the block is a game changer lol

1281,769109,2019-11-03,"We passed a wonderful week at ""Chooklyn Farms""! The appartment is cozy and the beds are very comfortable. It's  located in a nice neighbourhood and we felt very safe, even at night. The next subway station is within walking distance and if you are too lazy you can also take the bus. Genevieve was very friendly and always ready to give us good advice, she really made us feel at home. Barley, the dog, is so cute, we'll miss him. If we come back to New York we will definitely stay at this place again."

1289,330080,2019-05-06,"A totally comfortable and pleasing place to stay in a great area of Brooklyn. A short walk to restaurants, shops, subway, and beautiful parks. Lots of little touches make this an exceptionally fine accommodation."
1290,831743,2020-11-07,"Othman was kind, thoughtful and very quick to respond. His home is clean and well decorated. A few notes about the location: There is no legal street parking nearby so I would not recommend it for anyone with a car. Honestly I don’t recommend a car for a visit anywhere in the city though - public transportation is so reliable, easy and fast so why bother with the hassle? The apartment is located just under the 59th St Bridge and while it is peaceful and cozy you can hear the traffic from the bedroom. My stay was in the fall of 2020 when I was working remotely and found the apartment to be quite cold which meant working on a computer in a winter jacket and gloves. Othman did try to schedule service with the building to look at the radiators but no one came during the 4 hour service window we booked. The neighborhood is fun with lots of great restaurants, bars and stores. I would definitely recommend a stay."

1302,432722,2021-11-07,"Emily and Matt’s place was stylish, cozy, practical, and a lovely home base! I had recently moved back to NYC and was in the middle of working remotely while searching for my own apartment. They helped me out with an early check in, switching around my reservation dates, letting me get packages delivered, and answering any questions I had throughout my stay. I not only really appreciated their kindness, but also thoroughly enjoyed the space itself. From the inviting kitchen, to the in-unit W/D, to the comfy bed, it was a safe and homey place to be. It was a bit of a walk to the subway, but the neighborhood is filled with trees and beautiful, impressive brownstones. Highly recommend to others!"
1303,619772,2019-04-15,"Ingrid is one the most welcoming and warmest hosts that I've ever had (and that's saying something I use Airbnb a lot). She's always making sure that you're doing well by giving the exact amount of attention (super reactive, very understanding and also let's you do your thing!). I highly recommend"

1308,410497,2019-09-30,Great place to stay! Did not see the cat unfortunately but did hear it through a door.
1309,793518,2021-11-29,"This apartment is definitely a comfortable home away from home. Pristine linens, nicely decorated, quiet and hosted by a wonderful local family made my visit a great experience. Having a kitchen and laundry access beats a hotel stay for me. I’ll be back next year."
1310,519996,2019-06-29,"Wer ein wenig Ruhe von New York benötigt, ist hier sehr gut aufgehoben. Die (kostenfreie) Fahrt mit der Ferry, gibt einem morgens die Zeit sich innerlich vorzubereiten und abends die Möglichkeit zu entschleunigen."
1311,380528,2019-09-14,"By far the best Airbnb. Delroy is a perfect host, the house is big and is sparkling clean with everything you could possibly need for a very comfortable stay, plus much more. Thank you Delroy for the fruit, milk, coffee etc... very thoughtful and much appreciated.<br/><br/>The location is great, very pleasant neighbourhood we felt safe and it was calm and quiet. A 10 minute walk to the train which connects to the free Staten Island ferry will take you on a beautiful 25minute ride into lower Manhatten.<br/><br/>We would recommend Delroys home 100% without a doubt and will definitely return on our next trip to New York."
1312,560921,2019-06-28,"Awesome place!! Had a great time in nyc, wish I could’ve stayed longer"

1319,481585,2020-01-03,"Terrific apartment in the heart of SoHo. The location is perfect for walking around SoHo and the West Village. It was such a treat to walk out the door and visit excellent cafes, stores, and restaurants, day after day. The apartment is also only 1/2 a block from a great 24hr bodega what was very handy. -- The apartment itself is very comfortable, with an excellent layout and wonderful living room / kitchen. Loved it and would definitely return."
1320,660486,2019-09-06,"This is in the heart of the residential area of Flushing Queens, and a 15 min walk from Main street and subway. Stayed here for a week while in NY to watch tennis at Flushing Meadows Corona park. Served my purpose well. <br/><br/>Positives:<br/><br/>Very calm and quiet neighbourhood.<br/><br/>Room is very clean, bright and spacious. I stayed in two of the rooms and both were nice. <br/><br/>Amazingly quick response by the hosts, very convenient check -in. Very professional and helpful. Their relatives stay in the house, and are always available in case you need to check in late. They don't speak much English, but are really sweet. <br/><br/>Common area has a fully functional kitchen, utensils, kettle and almost anything else one might need to cook. Each room gets a shared refrigerator too. <br/><br/>The WiFi is pretty fast most of the time.<br/><br/>There is a deli, a convenience store, laundromat, and several chinese eateries, all within a 5 min walking distance from the place. <br/><br/>Negatives:<br/><br/>There is just one non -chinese eating joint nearby, and not too good. Main street has a lot of eateries though. <br/><br/>There is a bus stop right across the street that connects to the subway at Main street, but it is not too regular. Main street is about 15 mins by walk. <br/><br/>The folks in the adjoining room were really loud a couple of nights. There are 8 rooms in one floor, and if you are a light sleeper, might get a bit problematic."
1321,510721,2019-07-05,"Great place to stay with big courtyard, accessible backyard, and spacious rooftop to enjoy the view of the city!"

1326,228696,2021-05-03,"I had a great time at John’s place. The communication was super easy and quick and so was check in and our. The place looks like it does on the pictures.

1327,57555,2020-01-06,"I had booked Eric's apartment for a whole month for my parents to visit. They really enjoyed their stay and particularly enjoyed all of the recommendations Eric had provided for places to go and eat in the neighborhood. Eric's apartment is very conveniently located near a ton of great restaurants, grocery stores, and the subway. Eric was attentive, helpful, and responsive throughout my parents' stay. Thanks so much for everything!"

1329,829278,2021-06-24,What a great stay! Really enjoyed the common area that was filled with plants and sitting out on the balcony.

1333,453764,2019-05-10,"The apartment is very spacious for three people and it is quite cosy. Very conveniently located close to the Metro G line and in a nice (not yet gentrified) neighborhood. The flat could have been cleaner (might partially be due to the fact that we arrived earlier than announced..). The bathroom was good and the beds confortable. Note: if noise bothers you, this might not be the place for you: you can hear planes landing in JFK and the fridge can be quite noisy from time to time. Also the windows / doors are not well isolated. However, it did not matter much for us and we overall had a good stay. Thanks Aj!"
1334,326139,2021-08-30,"Great and clean unit! My friend and I stayed comfortably in the Striver's Row apartment for 3 nights. We had no issues checking in, sleeping, or otherwise, and the air conditioning was crucial. We also loved this area of Harlem and found it highly walkable and easy for accessing transit. Would definitely recommend!"
1335,341871,2020-03-19,Barry's place is my go-to-place.  I have stayed at several Airbnbs and this is my absolute favorite place to stay.    It is always clean and quiet.  Barry is very friendly and helpful.  Parking is a dream.
1336,711101,2019-03-19,I had a nice time in Denises house. The matress in the bed was great - even for someone like me with as permanently damaged discogenic. Its also very clean. For me it was totally problemfree there. A busstop is extremely close. and the ferry from Staten Island to Manhattan is for tourists a nice attraction. I would book this room again.
1337,370103,2019-03-30,This spot is perfect for a small group or family. I stayed here with my daughter and her 3 children ages from 16 to toddler and we had plenty of space. It’s a very beautiful space as well. It’s a pleasant surprise after getting up to 3rd floor. The hostess was always right there to help with anything. Short walk to convenience stores and subway.
1338,208005,2021-07-05,Suzanne’s place is awesome! A beautiful room in a fantastic neighborhood conveniently located between two major subway stops.  I will definitely stay with Suzanne next time I’m in NYC.
1339,158511,2019-04-17,"Sam went above and beyond to accommodate our 1 am check-in due to a delayed flight and offered tips for late night deli around the corner.  Communication was great all throughout the stay.  He is even sending back the laptop charger we left behind. Location is excellent for us family of 4 which, along with Sam's hospitality and a reasonable price, more than made up for the limited square footage."
1340,690726,2019-08-23,Great place
1341,274073,2020-03-12,Stephen’s place is in a wonderful area of Soho! Such a good value for such a well maintained apartment in one of the most fashionable areas of NYC! Definitely worth the time!

1346,847354,2021-10-09,Great hosts!
1347,608571,2019-11-30,"Perfect communication, really clean apartment."
1348,754522,2019-12-11,"If there was 6 stars to give I would... I couldn’t of asked for better hosts and the apartment was incredible. Every communication was friendly, helpful and always speedy. Felt so welcome in their home and anything we needed we were made to feel like VIP guests. <br/>The apartment itself was even more than we expected, let’s start with the obvious, the bed was incredibly dreamy, the shower was heavenly, never seen such a big TV so movie night was brilliant but I think most of all the view from the balcony took our breath away! Water was always hot and host had plenty of towels and extra bedding. The apartment is on the same street as the Empire State so minutes walk away, as well as Grand Central Station and Time Square. I would definitely recommend staying.. thank you so much for such an amazing place to stay."
1349,866034,2021-08-27,This place is truly amazing
1350,617951,2019-12-16,"Justine and Adrian were absolutely wonderful, after having a last-minute emergency they kindly packed me and my girlfriend some snacks for our flight home before we even made it to the door. Would highly recommend them for anyone's visit to Brooklyn."

1354,479651,2021-05-01,"Very nice space in a great location. I did feel like the living room could’ve been a tad cleaner, there seemed to be a faint odor... but nothing unbearable. I also saw there was a Nescafé machine and was looking forward to using that, but no coffee for it... bit of a bummer but also not such a big deal. Overall a nice, surprisingly spacious apartment in the heart of bushwick."
1355,838358,2021-08-16,The room was nice. The view was beautiful.
1356,854510,2021-05-09,"Stay away. When we arrived at the room, we realized it was a much smaller room then this room they’re showing in the picture. Not even a table. We had to fight for them to change us to a room like in the picture. Then, for the checkout, we asked for the lockers to leave our luggage (as they described in the listing) and there are no lockers."
1357,794352,2020-02-10,"Overall great stay and close to the train station, let us check out a bit later and everyone in the neighborhood was nice, great two deli’s walking distance and supermarket walking distance."
1358,802615,2021-06-04,"I am absolutely amazed with my experience. The apartment is almost brand new, extra cozy and clean with lots of sunlight. The neighbourhood is safe with plenty of restaurants, bars, shops, supermarkets, banks and coffee shops within a walking distance. <br/>Andrew is a wonderful host who’d go out of the way to accommodate his guests and make sure they’re enjoying. He is genuine and kind. <br/>Would highly recommend and looking forward to staying there again soon <br/>Xx"

1371,732242,2019-08-12,"Good convenient location and clean but the air con is so noisy make sure you bring ear muffs. Also very small flat if there are more than 4 people. <br/>The bathroom designer needs an award for fitting the shower, loo and whb in such a small space."

1376,607773,2019-03-24,"We had a wonderful stay at Shannon’s place. The apartment was very stylish and comfortable. The crib, high chair, and kids books and toys were a huge plus as we were traveling with our 2-year-old. Shannon was very nice and super responsive. Would love to stay here again next time we are in Brooklyn!"
1377,553920,2021-11-05,"Wow! What a great find. Super clean and well furnished. Awesome location with lots of places to eat. Joanna was super responsive and friendly, but also let us have our space. Really only have positive things to say. Thanks for a great stay Joanna and Brian"

1384,641835,2019-12-01,Sparkling clean with a private bathroom. All new IKEA furnitures. The pillow is a little soft otherwise excellent.
1385,322745,2019-10-13,"Haffro the host was kind and accommodating, the location is amazing and walkable to cool parts of manhattan but does get noisy at night. giving 4 stars because on my last night, the host's roommate brought over a big group of friends at 4am to drink and blast music even though he was aware that a guest was staying in his home. Haffro was not home nor responsive to my texts so I told the group to quiet down/ move the party, which they did, but the roommate was being quite rude about it and talking sh*t. if people have Airbnb guests in their home they should be accommodating toward the guest, even if they're not the official host."
1386,671876,2021-06-30,"Loved everything about this place! Great host, very artistic and tastefully decorated East Village loft, and amazing location!"

Great little kitchen which meant we were able to have breakfast and dinner in the apartment which helped our finances as New York isn’t cheap! The area is very friendly and it feels like a genuine NY experience."

1390,610669,2019-11-17,"This is not a cozy place. Rented it out in November and the place was drafty, heat was on and off (no way to change it from the unit), pipes were leaking inside next to the bed and the bathroom was rid with mold. Not sure about the other reviews, but we did not have a pleasant stay. <br/>It is however close to a subway station and restaurants where you can go to escape the cold. Save yourself some trouble and book a hotel."
1391,732858,2021-10-24,"Chris’ place is perfect for a long or short stay. It was very clean and had everything I needed for a week’s long stay. Location was great, walking distance from the park and other great bars and breakfast spots. It’s a little bit of a walk to a subway station though the walk is scenic! And bus lines are right around the block."

1394,547829,2019-02-07,Steven's house is enormous! I was blown away by how much space there was. The room was clean and quiet. I rarely heard anyone in the house. It was a perfect landing place for my business trip in New York.
1395,732642,2019-10-12,"Marios was a great host. He was always responsive to messages, and the check-in process was simple. This apartment was one of the most affordable we could find in Manhattan, and was close to everything we wanted to see in Manhattan and Brooklyn. I would definitely stay in this Airbnb again."

1399,523745,2019-04-28,Wonderful and convenient location for a quick stay in Brooklyn.
1400,636557,2021-07-12,"My stay at Dena’s apartment was perfect for the short weekend that I was visiting. The neighborhood is great, the building and apartment very charming. Access was easy and Dena communicated appropriately. <br/><br/>My only complaint is that it wasn’t obvious the apartment had been thoroughly cleaned before my stay - the only trash bin was full and there was hair in the shower drain. Neither were huge problems for me, but worth noting."
1401,699106,2019-08-18,Tess’ apartment was somehow even better than the pictures and was a fantastic homebase for us on our trip to New York!
1402,202123,2021-09-04,"Rosa is very friendly host, she is helpful and personable. Her place is cozy and in a great location. I felt like I was at home. I had a wonderful time and would love to stay here again!"

1405,398258,2021-11-15,"Griffin BnB was perfect for us in so many ways.  The neighborhood is wonderful, with some of the most stunning houses in Brooklyn.  It’s a pleasure to walk around and look at some of the architecture.  The house is only a block and a half from the Q train, so it’s really easy to get to Manhattan.  The place is very spacious with two large bedrooms, an enormous bathroom, and a big enough living and dining area.  Jeannine and Buck were always very responsive to our requests and proactively checked on us periodically.  We would definitely stay here again."
1406,723461,2019-06-17,Great value
1407,486011,2019-11-06,"My wife and I spent a few days at Cris's house, and the experience was excellent. The apartment is very clean and cozy.<br/><br/>Cris is very friendly and always available to answer any questions. She was very nice, allowing us to leave our bags in the apartment after checkout. This helped us a lot because our flight was only at the end of the day.<br/><br/>We love the place.<br/><br/>Highly recommended."
1408,743600,2021-07-02,Very Clean. Quite cozy. Very firm bed. Walls a little thin so light sleepers might have an issue. Overall a very nice and comfortable space. Angelica was great on communicating and they were very helpful. It's 5 stars for me!

Easy to get to/shared bathroom.  10-12 minute walk to the subway.<br/>Soledad was very nice (didn't meet Martin).<br/>Would absolutely stay there again."
1412,695244,2020-01-19,"Spectacular. Clean. Easy access to subway, restaurants and grocery stores. For anyone looking for an AirBNB—- look no further."
1413,745118,2019-10-05,"This location is absolutely perfect and the place is very economic.  We did have an issue with getting into the unit with the very strict front deck, but Ysabel quickly helped us resolve the issue by getting everyone added to the list and was not her fault.<br/><br/>Make sure you get all your guests registered before arriving!"
1414,440972,2019-02-01,Pretty and stylish apartment with a nice and clean room.

1419,487918,2021-06-15,Really enjoyed my stay a lot . Had privacy and Seeranie was a really nice person with great communication.
1420,830098,2021-07-26,"The place was very spacious for a studio, it is close to parks , buses, etc. the space was very clean and this room will provide you with almost everything you need from washer/dryer to kitchen necessities (you probably gonna have to provide yourself with extra essentials but that’s okay) the area is very peaceful and somewhat secluded, but it works out for me because I’m an introvert. I would most definitely book here again"
1421,662993,2019-08-03,Excelente servicio. Alexander es un amor de persona y muy buena onda. Súper cómodo todo.
1422,191059,2019-07-20,Helen is a great host.  She pays attention to small details and  always makes sure her guests are comfortable.

1425,689656,2019-09-30,Super cute place. It was a perfect location and has all the basics that you need to enjoy your stay. Close to the ferry just an Uber ride away. You can walk to stores— and Veronica keeps in touch with you throughout your stay. We had an amazing time visiting the Island and we were very happy with our stay.
1426,660322,2019-01-09,Good place
1427,697355,2019-08-09,"Good area all around. Parking is great and free. The Airbnb itself was very clean and even had little necessities like toothbrushes, razor blade, etc in case you left something at home"
1428,395631,2020-01-15,"Awesome stay! The location is perfect: just a couple minute walk to the nearest subway station (Chauncey Street). We were able to get around the five Burroughs conveniently. Also, the place was clean, had great amenities, and had nice decorative touches. Definitely worth it!"
1429,861843,2021-05-09,pretty good place to stay for a hangout or night out. very nice tv & bathroom. very nice & respectful host

1437,746236,2021-09-22,"Staying in the West Village is a dream, and Mike's apartment is so cozy and full of character. It was honestly hard to leave! There's actually a really nice view of the new World Trade Center from the kitchen. I loved seeing that view as the first thing in the morning and the last thing at night. For as small a place as it is, it has a kitchen, living room, and bedroom, which I enjoyed over a simple studio.<br/><br/>Sullivan St is full of life, so you will feel right in the mix of things, especially the very young NYU culture. Washington Square Park is a magical place, only a block away. I went there every day, and it quickly became my go-to spot to eat a meal on the go, hang out and watch people, or read a book. <br/><br/>It's a 6th floor walkup, but you get used to it. It's also an old building but that's what gives it its charm.<br/><br/>Mike is incredibly warm, caring, and thorough. He will make every effort to meet your needs. I feel personally connected to Mike and the apartment after my stay. Such a precious experience, highly highly recommended."
1438,868338,2021-06-06,"Excellent hosts. I came to plan and attend my father's funeral and Javier was very attentive when I needed anything. The apartment was newly renovated and clean. The downstairs mattress was too soft for me and there was no TV but the apartment and amenities were great. Be warned of the 3 flights of stairs to get to the apartment. I have knee problems, so if you are not used to stairs or are injured this will hurt you. Also, the police station and train will provide some sirens and you will feel rumbling. Overall I had a great visit in a great vibrant city location. This is my hometown and it felt very homey. Neighbors nice too. Thanks Javier. I will visit again."
1439,657405,2019-07-11,"Very pleasant stay in Lore's apartment. Perfectly situated, definitly recommended."
1440,524835,2019-05-07,"Femi’s place was clean & spacious. Close access to transit. Communication was excellent. Very thoughtful as far as amenities such as the light breakfast items, the blow dryer came in handy , it rained a portion of our stay and we all forgot our umbrellas but there were two available for use. Definitely pleased and would stay again!"
1441,891332,2021-11-29,Henry is a was very friendly and I had a very good time in his apartment.
1442,814532,2021-06-29,"Very Spacious apartment, location was good for us. The deli next door had good late night food. There were quite a few steep stairs, something to consider if that is difficult for you. Jase was very responsive and helpful!"
1443,564319,2019-05-19,You can expect a very friendly and helpful host who provides anything you need at any time with a smile.
1444,756880,2019-09-30,Great get away in the city not too far from the beach if you want to make the trip.

1448,461918,2020-10-17,"This was by far my favorite Airbnb experience! Tim's place is in a great location and the space is beautiful + comfortable. I ended up working from home quite a bit, and it was such an enjoyable experience. Tim was kind and personable, but wasn't around much (I never felt like we were in each other's way). He was a superb host and I cannot recommend his place enough!"
1449,624327,2021-02-21,Warm feel. Private driveway was great and is a rare find in brooklyn. Would definitely stay here again!

1456,152222,2021-05-24,"Dawn is nice and makes sure to communicate well. The room is quite small but for a few days, could be ok. I would probably not stay again as it's not the comfiest surrounds, especially for an extended period."
1457,820126,2021-07-01,Great Airbnb! Me and my boyfriend loved it. Very accommodating.
1458,723893,2019-08-23,"Place was too run down, bedrooms with no blinds or curtains, the bed I slept in was very uncomfortable (actually slept in the couch in order to be more comfortable), the front door was incredibly hard to lock/unlock. Would definitely not call this a “beautiful” apartment."
1459,349756,2019-02-19,"The place is super close to subway, only 3-4 min walk and it is 20 min to Times Square by subway. Check-in and check-out were very easy. However, the room is really small and the wardrobe was already full of towels and bedlinens so I couldn’t use it. WiFi connection was also poor. These were not big problems for me  though since I only stayed a few nights, and I was mostly out."
1460,576119,2019-10-19,"Very quiet and cosy place to stay, center of Manhattan is only 30 minutes away by public transport. Mairo was very nice. We had a lovely week in NYC!"
1461,458345,2019-10-26,"Anna's place is lovely and she herself is even lovelier, really goes the extra mile as a host. The place itself is lovely and it's nice and quiet at night, which isn't always the case in the big city!"
1462,519827,2021-07-23,The apartment is located in a great spot. The place is very spacious and the communication with Dan is very good.
1463,210847,2019-09-29,"l’ Appartement correspond parfaitement aux photos, il est très propre et très fonctionnel et agréable à vivre.

1464,853158,2021-08-31,"I had an incredible 2 month stay at Robert’s place! Check in process was smooth, and Rob was  very reliable with his responses regarding any questions I had about the apartment.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the location as it was a 30 second walk to the Q and close to many amazing restaurants. The apartment itself was stocked with everything I could need, an amazing TV in the living room, fully updated bathroom, and very comfy bed. <br/><br/>Rob was a great host and I am already looking forward to my next trip to the city."

1468,810711,2021-06-27,"Zahir was great with communication<br/>They provided all the necessary instructions to get to your room the day of check in. The place was very clean, super close to LGA airport (I think 10-15 min walk), and really comfy. I didn't explore the area around it as it was just a means of walking to the airport the morning after, but the neighborhood was nice and quiet. Would recommend for a quick stop before flying out the next day"
1469,439725,2019-04-09,"Rony's place was exactly what we had hoped for! Super clean, well kept, stylish, quiet, comfortable...all with an awesome view off the balcony. Check in and check out was extremely simple. Rony was always available at any time if we needed anything, super easy to talk to, and was very welcoming. The location was great too because it was just a short  (5-7 minute) walk to the subway or bus line (we used both). We can't wait to go back! :)"

1473,661599,2020-01-19,Adriana is the perfect host. She gave me a warm welcome and made sure I was well fed :) Her husband made the best coffee and she even taught me how to make arepa! I was happy to learn so much about her culture. Adriana is super kind and patient. She tried to accommodate the best she can. I cannot ask for a better host. Will definitely stay at hers again the next time I visit New York!

Jp was very quick in responding to any questions. <br/>Cons- My room was on the 5th floor and there is no elevator which is mentioned in the description. <br/>The corridors smelt of smoke from other tenants living in the building.

1484,38799,2021-09-11,This is a great spot to stay in an ideal location about a block away from the L line. The unit is modern and spacious with most of the amenities you'd want for a long-term stay. Mary and Charles were responsive and easy to work with. I would definitely book this location again in the future!
1485,794431,2021-05-06,It was an absolute delight staying with Anthony. I was very available and laid back. He answered questions day and night and even stayed up to allow me to come in late.<br/>The apartment overall is a great Caribbean vibe mixed with an NY flair. <br/>Anthony is a great host and I wish many other host could meet him and take note.
1486,583429,2019-04-24,"No way will you be staying near Madison Square Garden or near a subway station.  If you're arriving at Penn Station (in the same building as the Garden), and you have luggage, prepare for a 15-20 minute walk or else take a taxi.  The walk may be a bit shorter from the 8th Avenue subway stop at Times Square.  <br/>The apartment is a second floor walk-up, with a long, steep flight of stairs but good lighting.  The entire apartment is very clean, and my guest room was quieter than I'd expected.  <br/>The apartment has a shared kitchenette with a sink and refrigerator. <br/>If you're collecting keys left for you at a restaurant nearby,  the place may be closed.   (Not sure whether they'd answer if you called.)  When I arrived at the 11 am check-in time, the restaurant's front door was locked.   Fortunately a workman on the street knocked hard on the restaurant door until someone let me in. <br/>The host, while pleasant over the phone and prompt with email replies, seems not to have understood 100% of my English.  (As a native speaker, I've taught English as a Second Language at Berlitz in Manhattan and Princeton, NJ.)   In writing to the host, it's good to be direct and more specific than you might be otherwise.   The host may not read between the lines, for example, when a request could be assumed but isn't stated as a request.<br/>The host seems to have a weekday job not close to the bnb.   He'd probably appreciate advance notice to bring anything to the apartment, along with a cell phone # to use (if needed) during your stay.   <br/>The bed was clean and comfortable, and the indoor temperature was comfortable for me.  The host supplies no more than two pillows per bed, however.<br/>The only mirror is in the shared bathroom.  If you're rushed and need a mirror (for make-up or whatever), bring your own.  Also bring a device to wake you up, since my guest room at least had no clock.  No Kleenex in the apartment either anywhere that I could find."
1487,771721,2021-09-17,"Nice place, nice owner."
1488,710715,2020-04-30,Love this place will be booking over and over and over lol I feel so much at home
1489,576584,2019-04-15,Cynthia was very sweet and attentive to all my needs. The place was very clean and perfect for my son and I. There were also plenty of food places and local stores close by. There were amazing Jamaican restaurants in the area. I felt safe and would love to stay there again when I return.
1490,13919,2021-08-23,Waynes place is in a good spot for shopping and near the train. Wayne was a wonderful host . He made sure we were comfortable  <br/>and I would stay there again.
1491,778881,2021-09-04,"We stayed here while we went to the US Open tennis tournament in Flushing Queens.  It was very comfortable, had all the amenities we needed, and was close to good restaurants.  Thanks, Jey!"
1492,880948,2021-09-12,"Location was great with restaurants and cafes at your doorstep.  Time Square and Central Park within walking distance.<br/>Dan was great with his communication and replied Instantly to any questions before and during the stay. <br/>The place was very clean, comfortable for 2 or 3 adults and provided towels, shampoo, masks etc. 3rd floor walk up which he shared in his posting. Being NYC and booking somewhere so central, expect it to be busier and can hear some noise from the street but unless you’re staying in a high rise hotel, you should expect this in NYC."
1493,662011,2020-01-06,Great location
1494,711894,2019-06-12,This place was awesome. The space was much bigger then I expected! Beds were super comfy. AC worked well!

1513,265393,2019-10-08,"Over it was a great place to stay! It’s a convenient location, a few minutes away from the subways that take you straight into the city."
1514,144430,2019-09-18,We really enjoy being at Skippy's house.  He is very considerate and kind.  Your cats are very cute.  It was a unique and special experience.  Your Brooklyn home is in a great location.  Thank you friend Skippy.

1516,837728,2021-05-02,Amazing balcony space overlooking the park and overall perfect location!
1517,661488,2019-04-17,"Die Unterkunft ist durch ihre Lage sehr vorteilhaft. Im Grunde muss man nur einmal die Straße überqueren, um zu einem halbwegs vernünftigen Einkaufsmarkt und zur Straßenbahn zu kommen. Die Bahn führt auch direkt nach Manhattan und man ist in ca 25 Minuten mittendrin.<br/>Diese Bahn ist allerdings auch nicht gerade leise, hat und allerdings nicht gestört. Sollte man nur wissen.<br/>Ein eigenes Bad ist natürlich super, aber es könnte eine Renovierung vertragen.<br/>Anton selbst haben wir nur kurz am Abreisetag getroffen, ansonsten eine Mitbewohnerin, die aber eher unauffällig war.<br/>Check In problemlos über eine Lockbox.<br/>Alles in allem genügt diese Unterkunft jedenfalls für einen guten, günstigen Aufenthalt, um NYC einige Tage zu erkunden, ohne viel Schnickschnack und Luxus."
1518,302285,2020-06-18,"We enjoyed our stay at Emmanuelle’s place. The bedroom was very tranquil, with lots of natural light and large curtains in case we wanted it dark. Having a private bathroom was an excellent amenity. The balcony right outside the bedroom was lovely. The other guest bedroom has access to it as well but there’s more than enough room to share or have one side to yourself.<br/><br/>Emmanuelle was very welcoming and offered coffee/tea as well as other kitchen supplies for preparing meals. We would totally stay here again."
1519,637868,2021-08-02,"Great Place to stay close the waterfront, we’re you get a fantastic view of the city."
1520,858443,2021-06-27,"The listing was clean and comfortable. Perfect  size, great location and fairly priced! Ann Marie was communicable. I would stay here again!"
1521,721819,2021-10-11,"We didn't get a chance to stay due to massive and continued cancellations by Southwest but what remains true is that both Vanessa and Andrew went above and beyond to answer any and all queries, understand and empathize with our situation, accommodate our dates by adding an extra day. It is a different story altogether that we got our rescheduled flights (even the connecting ones) canceled as well. It was at that time we call it quits."
1522,706792,2019-09-19,"Very cozy place, quiet, the bed is really good I could sleep very well. It is walkable from Subway station."
1523,686460,2021-03-09,I felt so comfortable in Linda's apartment that I would love to live there full time.  It was pristine and had everything I needed.  The location is perfect between two subway lines and I felt safe in the neighborhood no matter the time.  Linda was very responsive and checked in just to make sure everything was going well.  Extremely thoughtful.  I would stay here again and again and again.  I highly recommend Linda's lovely place.
1524,311096,2021-03-19,"Amazing, very clean, very homey, and comfortable."

1529,402103,2019-08-18,"Fantastic location close to Prospect Park. Our boys loved the downstairs loft, especially. And the outdoor space was a special treat for summertime evenings. Clean, comfortable, and extremely convenient. Made for a great Brooklyn weekend for our family."
1530,239665,2019-11-21,The location is really great. Walking distance to everything that you will need. The apartment is very stylish and homey too
1531,705731,2019-12-29,This place was so good! It was cute and comfortable. I loved that they had a kitchenette. Laureta was also really fast with communication when I had a few questions. Also loved how close it was to all great bars and activities and the train. Would definitely recommend.
1532,870483,2021-07-15,"This is the perfect place to have a very different kind of NYC stay. We loved everything about it. We struggled a little to get into the marina, but that was just our lack of familiarity with the system. It was fairly easy to figure out. <br/>Very laid back marina. Showers and bathrooms were basic and clean. Almost always empty. People at the marina were friendly and quiet. We really enjoyed the mix of peaceful serenity as we enjoyed a glass of wine on the deck with passing swans contrasted with the huge planes taking off from the airport like rumbling ghosts through the low clouds. It was surreal. <br/>Transport was right outside the marina door. Took the bus to the ferry and enjoyed a nice sail to Southstreet area. <br/>We had everything we needed on the boat and anything extra was easy to get at the market right outside the marina. <br/>Loved our stay. It was relaxed and easy and a very different way to enjoy everything that nyc has to offer with none of the stress."
1533,695738,2019-07-24,"Kind people in a quiet,  beautyful and very good located neighbourhood"
1534,86331,2020-01-06,A nyc basement apartment.
1535,303976,2019-09-06,"Good for those seeking a bed to crash between sightseeing. The property is essentially a hostel, with around 10 rooms of varying sizes, two bathrooms and kitchens, one on each floor. Didnt meet host but she answered questions promptly and fixed the wifi when it went down. Kitchen did not feel clean however but the room was and had good aircon. Good location for subway, R and W train direction to 42nd/Times Sq etc, good for airports too. Host was happy for me to leave bags in kitchen after check out time, which was much appreciated. Thanks again."
1536,579327,2019-06-19,"The place is good, the lady is friendly"
1537,75624,2021-10-13,"Karen seems like a great person.<br/><br/>Her son is very nice helpful and replies instantly to any requests or questions. He recommends nice restaurants in the area.<br/><br/>Their dog is super cute and small, she loves being pet and doesn’t make any noise at all (except for the small coughs every couple of hours).<br/><br/>The description of the house is on point, upper east side is a great place to stay, the place is clean and organized. Its pretty small with very limited space as described by Karen (thats how Manhattan is).<br/><br/>The apartment is quite, no noisy neighbors.<br/><br/>My issue is that Karen was away on vacation, which allows more space for me in the apartment, but unfortunately, her dog was quite upset about being home along all the time (I worked 12-14 hours a day, sometimes more) and although she was walked and fed by Karen’s son, it made sure to poop on the floor almost every single day. I didnt voice my concerns to Karen, but did to her son. Unfortunately, all he did was cleanup after the dog whenever it pooped on the floor. It was horrible waking up to spots of poop on the floor almost every day, with a foul smell. Finally, 2 days prior to me leaving (10 day stay) her son took the dog and kept her in his apartment, but I think the damage was already done.<br/><br/>One small issue with the room, is that if you close the door, open the window and turn the fan on, the room would still be hot, otherwise its a nice place."
1538,169216,2019-10-07,good basic accomodation
1539,100676,2020-11-15,"Definitely if you have a chance to bunk at Wilfredo’s place do so. It’s serene, safe, clean. And the communication was stellar !"
1540,736014,2019-07-06,Great spot in Brooklyn at a great price. Best deal for the space!
1541,830857,2021-03-07,Staying at Joshua was great. I would stay there again.
1542,879134,2021-09-16,"I have been living in Airbnb’s for over 1.5 years…this is far the best Airbnb I have ever experienced!! From the layout to decorations, the peace and relaxation…it’s just phenomenal!"
1543,771542,2020-02-04,"Value for money to stay here.<br/>Excellent hospitality and good location near to subway, market and bus stop for LaGuardia Airport."
1544,458578,2019-01-07,Yves’ place was a cool space Very nice for a basement No parking at all in the area but it was a good area
1545,284356,2019-06-24,Quiet neighborhood and close to the subway if you need to get into the city. Check in was a breeze and I like the extra security with the coded lock on the outside. Free street parking is available. Very cute home!
1546,782566,2019-12-26,"The place is amazing! Everything is super close, it has Times Square two block away, subway station, lot of places to eat around! The best place to stay if you’re visiting NYC"

1548,810363,2020-09-23,"Great location and  apartment was very clean.  Marie always answered promptly to any communications.  It was smaller than in the photos but just fine for our needs.   Lots of great restaurants within a few blocks, too!"
1549,795821,2020-01-22,Great host and space
1550,772686,2021-04-16,Nis' spot is very convenient for exploring Brooklyn and the rest of the city. Nearest subway stop is less than two blocks away. Two other subway lines are less than 10 minutes away. Ton of bike share stations and there are greats bars and restaurants on 5th Ave. Nis is quick to answer any questions and check-in was quite easy. Would definitely stay again.
1551,613215,2019-06-16,"Kathryn’s place is such a delight, with very comfortable accommodations, tasteful decorations and everything you could possibly need. I love the roof deck, back patio and neighborhood cats. Most comfortable couch ever! I also enjoyed visiting the Beach 17th concession area, for a nice slice of NY life. Kathryn is a pro - extremely helpful and responsive, and she gets a gold star for installing solar on her home! ☀️"

1554,294465,2020-01-22,"Roland’s place is a hidden gem located in the heart of Jamaica, Queens. Situated smack dab in the middle of a well-trafficked commercial strip, the private space provides a refuge from the exterior noise. Add the large screen TV (which I did not use) and the complimentary gym, which I frequented, this Airbnb is definitely more than meets the eye. <br/><br/>Bonus: great hospitality by co-host Levi. Thanks guys."
1555,781482,2020-03-02,"We had a great time staying here. We booked late on the same day, and Nicole was super accommodating of that. The room itself is super beautiful and receives a lot of sunlight. It's in a large house with 3 floors. This room is on the third floor along with a living space + kitchen, which we were free to make use of. Everyone was very friendly and we felt really welcome there. Thanks Nicole / Thomas!"

Several restaurants, gas station, deli and etc are walking distance from the place. Aleksander is very attentive and relabel host. Communication was clear and very helpful. Home away from home! Enjoyed my stay and will be using this apartment again."
1566,840432,2021-10-04,"A ridiculous amount of space for the money.  Shlomo was attentive and answered any concerns we had extremely quickly.  Close to subway and awesome night life. The nightlife does come with a drawback, the music from a local club is loud on Friday and Saturday nights.   The beds could have been a bit softer, but all and all it was a fabulous space."
1567,699963,2021-04-29,"Such a cozy, well located place! I will never forget the amazing lilac tree on the patio. Heavenly!"
1568,852500,2021-10-11,"Really a perfect spot to go into Brooklyn during the day and come back to Queens at night for dinner and drinks. There are a bunch of great restaurants and bars literally on the same block, and there's a convenience store one minute away. You probably won't need parking, but there is a garage within a four minute walk. The apartment is super clean and spacious, and the provided snacks helped us get through a hectic weekend without having to make pitstops. Heidi was super communicative and clear. Highly recommended."
1569,30281,2019-05-25,"Clean, convenient and great communication!"
1570,409523,2019-11-14,"This was a great apartment for our family of 4. The bathroom was big and it was great to have 2 bedrooms, a kitchen and laundry especially in NYC! Karen also provided a full size crib for our baby! The location was very close to the Q train which got us everywhere we wanted to go quickly. We felt safe in the neighborhood and the apartment was pretty quiet considering the proximity to the hospital. My only issue was that although the windows are huge and let it great light during the day, at night our kids had a hard time falling asleep because the shades on the windows still let in some light even at night. Overall a nice place to stay in NYC if you want some space and still be able to get around easily."
1571,702752,2019-09-26,"The best Airbnb in the world!! Easy to get around the M subway take you directly to downtown Manhattan very clean, great teamwork. New York is amazing so the  place yo have to stay have to be amazing and this place is what it is."

1576,885078,2021-10-05,"Had a little confusion with the room door code/app syncing but after a quick phone call with Jurny we had the door code and no troubles after. Beautifully refurbished building in a former tenement neighborhood. Clean, nicely furnished rooms with everything you need and a TON of restaurants on the same block with outdoor dining patios. (Don't miss Shrimp Linguine at Dudley's.) Easy subway access (F train is closest) so easy to get anywhere in the city fast."
1577,590790,2021-09-13,Not a bad space to stay at all. Accurate description. Glad they had a desk & lots of space to keep belongings. The Place is kept clean. id have to say that the only downside was the awkwardly shaped bathroom & the whole 3 doors with different codes each time situation.
1578,413724,2020-02-19,"Nous avons été très bien accueillis par Shanie. Le studio est spacieux et bien aménagé. <br/>Très bien situé dans le Queens , proche de 2 stations de metro , quartier bien fréquenté. <br/>Mcdo, Wendy’s, Dunkin,  Supermarché a proximité<br/>Séjour parfait<br/>Nous reviendrons"

Also he asked if we want to clean our cloths or smthng in laundry (next door in same house). Location is very good, 5 min walk to many subway lines, 10 min walk to river. Good food stores, Target n other shops are near this flat, also café n bars. Our stay was very nice. I highly recommend this place for stay in NYC!!!"
1587,849880,2021-08-04,"The location is great and literally walking distance from plenty of restaurants and bars and shopping, my only complaint is that this listing says it’s a king size bed but it’s actually a queen which was a slight inconvenience when your partner isn’t a small person."
1588,645256,2019-07-24,Nice house but noise
1589,26717,2020-11-01,"Great location if you’re looking for the “authentic” NYC experience. Apartment is decent, could absolutely be cleaner and is in need of a few more amenities for long stays (hand towels, bath towels, toilet paper, etc).

Man findet alles, was man braucht, wir haben uns in der Wohnung sehr wohl gefühlt. Sie liegt nur 50m von der Hochbahn entfernt, der Endstation der roten Linie 3. Allein die Umgebung war für uns gewöhnungsbedürftig, aber man ist in 45 min in der Innenstadt. Das Preis-Leistungsverhältnis war für uns 5 sehr gut."

1600,122253,2021-07-27,Samuel is a great host and the location is great for the value just a few min walk to subways stops. Room is upstairs decent size and bathroom tub is a little high with windows always open with view from neighbors. No curtains to close it. just be aware. The air conditioning is a little loud. have to plug in and out of outlet to use. Just be mindfull host is always there and open to small talk.

They also allowed us to keep our bags at the hotel past check-out time, which was greatly appreciated. The space was clean and comfortable. Would stay here again! Thank you! :-)"
1605,175942,2021-03-03,"Muchas gracias por la cómoda estadía en Nueva York. La pieza es genial, muy cerca de todo y el servicio que entrega Marco es simplemente perfecto. Tenía absolutamente todo preparado y pensado para viajeros lo cual se agradece. Nos ayudó en los planes de nuestros días y siempre estuvo atento a cualquier necesidad que tuviéramos. Si volviera a la ciudad definitivamente me volvería a alojar donde Marco! "
1606,669348,2019-05-27,"Great place! Would definitely recommend. Great hosts and very responsive, one thing I would say is that it’s a little bit away from the nearest subway station...but if you live here for more than 3 days you’ll get used to it. Otherwise good place to stay!"

1618,636124,2019-06-30,We had a wonderful stay.  Very convenient to some wonderful restaurants and an easy walk to the train.  The apartment was very comfortable on some really hot and humid days.  It was just what we were looking for when we visited our son who lives in the neighborhood.
1619,719946,2019-08-04,Jamie's place was perfect for my friends and I when we visited NYC! The apartment was clean and exactly what is advertised. It is also in an amazing location; my friends and I had a super pleasant walk to the apartment from the Times Square area.
1620,744362,2020-02-18,This place is world class and the owner’s Hanya and Dan are world class as well.

1624,469638,2019-09-01,Impecable
1625,569740,2019-03-24,"Ervita's home is clean, well organized, and in a great location. We were able to hop right onto the metro a block away or take a walk in Prospect Park. We came to NYC for an exhibit at the Brooklyn Museum, and it was incredibly convenient. Thank you for everything, Ervita!"
1626,858852,2021-11-12,I enjoyed my stay here! The only difficult thing was finding the building (we are not native New Yorkers so that could have been the reason as well) and I don’t think I realized there would be so many stairs to climb (I had a lot of luggage). But overall it was nice and quiet and a great stay for the night. The room was very clean and we had spent the last couple of nights in the middle of time square so this was certainly way quieter and more peaceful. Overall I would recommend this for a quick stay to sleep and freshen up!
1627,861430,2021-11-28,"A comfortable place at a convenient spot in East Village. It was close to a lot of shops and subway stations, which is always great. However, we expected more in terms of cleanliness - some dishes are dirty and the coffee machine hasn't been cleaned after the last use. The curtain rod over the bed was also on the verge of falling, which was quite concerning. We also have to mention that the bar below was extremely loud at night, as in you can hear the bass and every conversation outside. The smell of weed was strong too.<br/><br/>Overall, the space was comfortable nevertheless. Most things you need will be provided. The host was also very friendly, accomodating, and fast to respond."
1628,370221,2021-07-09,Zoraida y su hermano omar son muy amables. La habitación está en una zona muy cómoda y la distancia al centro de Manhattan es muy corta solamente usando una línea del Subway. La habitación y el departamento está bastante limpio y cómodo!! La verdad uno de los mejores Airbnb’s donde me he quedado. Lo recomiendo!
1629,625887,2019-03-18,"This place was everything advertised and more.  Clean, modern, cozy with every imaginable amenity.  No TV but TV is overrated.  We stayed for 3 nights while visiting family.  The location is close to subways and cabs are easy to come by.  Close to the best stuff in Brooklyn.  Jessica was an amazing host and we will definitely be back!"
1630,252994,2019-08-25,Great space for the money! Frances was very accommodating for us! Enjoyed having water in the fridge!
1631,792969,2021-09-06,Host was very responsive and communication was key for our stay. Location was perfect close to everything. We would not hesitate to book this place again.
1632,884014,2021-11-17,"Easy to get to, great hosts very communicative, space was all that was needed on my nights stay for work. Internet ran smooth too!"
1633,679207,2019-11-11,"Kristie’s place was perfect for us for 5 nights. We loved the location, so close to the Highline and Sleep No More (if future guests are going its about a 3 minute walk) and convenient for transport links, restaurants and food stores, plus on the 1st floor (European) so doesn’t have masses of steps to toil up and down. Check in was simple and Kristie gave us a warm welcome to her apartment, which is as the photos show, perhaps a little bigger if anything. This is Kristie’s home which she allows Airbnb guests to use when she is away, and what we particularly liked is the fact that Kristie did what other Airbnb hosts don’t always do - and that is to clear drawer space and provide hangers so you can unpack. She is a thoughtful host, with plenty of towels and essential toiletries available and a extra set of keys so both guests can come and go as they wish if 2 of you are staying. It isn’t top luxury, as is reflected in the fair price, and as anywhere in New York you might want ear plugs and an eye mask, but we wouldn’t hesitate to stay here again if Kristie makes it available on a future visit. Thanks Kristie!"
1634,143628,2019-12-15,"Sole's apartment was perfect for our trip! It was very nice and surprisingly spacious for what I was expecting an NY studio to be. It is very close to a subway stop that takes you directly into Manhattan. We didn't get to explore the neighborhood too much because we spent our time in Manhattan, but the neighborhood seemed nice with some good food options. Sole was extremely helpful every step of the way from check in to check out. All in all, we loved our stay and you can't beat the price!"
1635,843709,2021-08-29,"Nice hotel with a view for a weekend in the city. Clean, friendly staff, and located in a nice area in the seaport district, easily accessible to transportation to get around the city."
1636,559579,2019-05-09,Good location and quiet neighborhood.  4 blocks away all the food and markets.
1637,566544,2019-01-12,A clean and spacious home. Also very comfy and warm and perks of having a kueirg machine to make your own coffee.
1638,798121,2020-03-04,Jay is great host. His apartment is located close to subway. There's no elevator so it might a little bit hard to carry big luggage for women but his room is quiet and cozy :)
1639,371868,2021-10-18,Me and my friends enjoyed our stay here while visiting New York. Michelle is amazing and answered all our questions and requests immediately. She even helped us find the closest place to get covid tested which saved us so much stress! Her place was very comfortable to stay as well and definitely worth booking.
1640,819048,2021-09-27,Great location and near everythung you need.
1641,638630,2019-01-17,"Excellent place, great location, very clean,  and clear communication. Towels, linens, shower toiletries all were great and wifi was super fast. Would stay again 100%."

1645,734467,2019-05-26,The host canceled this reservation 96 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1646,810297,2021-04-21,"The hosts Hellen and Omar are helpful and communicative.  The apartment was clean and super comfortable. There are other rooms in the apartment so you may not be the only guest, but you're welcome to be as social or not as you like."
1647,784577,2021-09-27,"Amazing people. Awesome location. Cutest room. Perfect stay. What can I say? This has been one of the best stays I've ever had on Airbnb and I have stayed in maybe 20+.<br/><br/>You will be staying in a private room in an apartment shared by Madison and Ahmed. They are the warmest nicest people and it has been amazing chatting with them and even hanging out a bit.<br/><br/>The room itself is super cute and cozy. The bed is comfy, the sheets and pillows super clean. You get windows filled with sunlight but can choose to close the curtains. The shared bathroom is next to the bedroom so it is super convenient. <br/><br/>The apartment is located very close to Subway stations if you want to go to Manhattan or other parts of Brooklyn. It is also super close to Central Williamsburg full of amazing restaurants and bars. There are plenty of cute options within a block or two as well.<br/><br/>Definitely recommend staying here. You won't regret it."
1648,153358,2019-05-05,"Great location. Lots of restaurants and things to do in the area. Excellent communication and hospitality. Thoughtful and creative decor. Great space. Very clean, well stocked with linens, toilet paper, toiletries. No complaints. Naz and her home were awesome."
1649,348232,2021-01-02,"This was a great place to stay at. While I did enjoy my stay, and Don is a wonderful host(even helped me being my stuff to my van when I left), I ended my reservation early because:<br/> 1.) Their house rules are very strict<br/> 2.) His friend Peter is a terrible, terrible person. Literally a monster. If you stay here, do your best to avoid him because if you end up getting in his way, or light a candle of a scent he doesn't like etc. he will be irritated and he will let you know. He's a very hostile person, and I feel bad that Don has to deal with him everyday. Best wishes Don and thank you for letting me stay at your place!"
1650,740911,2020-01-03,It was a good stay.
1651,629729,2019-12-06,Ok
1652,825648,2021-07-19,"This is a great manhattan budget room that's located just a couple blocks from from the 1 train. I usually spend my time in lower manhattan and Brooklyn, and even though the trip was a little bit longer, it was very easy and relaxing.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed exploring the surrounding neighborhood, as well. A very interesting mix of different shops and restaurants, and an amazing scenic park on the Hudson just 3 blocks away. The first restaurant I tried, Chick Inn, was great,with a very friendly crew too, and actually located on the ground floor of the same building.<br/><br/>The apartment is in a really cool old building, and the room is located in the main hallway of the apartment when you first walk in. So you can get to your room and assigned bathroom without really passing through any common areas. The one window in the room looks out on the interior courtyard, so it was eerily quiet and completely separated from the noise of the street. Although it is obviously a shared apartment with several rooms, and both short-and-long-term guests, I truly felt like I was alone most of the time. The shared bathroom I used felt more like a private just because it was right next to the room, and one of two in the apartment. I only encountered other guests/residents 2 times during my 5 day stay. I even felt like I had the elevator to myself most of the time!Marlon was very helpful in getting me checked in, telling me about the neighborhood, and explaining the house rules (which I really appreciate, because they are all just common sense  rules to keep the space pleaseant for everyone. Anyway, it's manhattan, plenty of room for noise and smoking and whatnot in the street!) He stopped by to make sure I was settled in, and then I never saw him again. Like I said, a shared apartment with regular roommates, but I truly felt like I was in a more private space...<br/><br/>One final note: this is a REAL airbnb in a REAL old uptown manhattan apartment building. It is not the sort of newly renovated investment property that's making rents unbearable and airbnb rates skyrocket. No, it is not possible, under those circumstances, to create a perfect brand new hotel room. And I am glad, because I could never afford such a place. Marlon clearly works hard to provide cleanliness and comfort for travellers in all the areas where it really matters. If you are a real budget traveler who wants to stay in a clean, comfortable, and basic room in Manhattan, then this is your spot. If you want a perfect, spotless, brand new hotel room, then add a couple zeroes to your budget and go do that."
1653,490830,2019-09-26,Our family had a great stay at Chaya’s place. The apartment was spacious and clean and the neighborhood has many shops and great restaurants. The hosts were accommodating as well. Thank you!

1655,611053,2020-08-28,"Eliana and her daughter were wonderful host. She was very accommodating with my schedule on checking in and throught my stay with my crazy hours of work. (I hope i wasn't too disruptive) lol...<br/>The house was very tidy and she was very responsive with messages, provided extra amenities, she even gave me some of her home cooked food! (which was delicious btw) I would definitely stay here again and recommend it if you're looking for a comfortable, welcoming, yet private stay! Thanks Eliana!"
1656,376089,2019-10-06,"This is a very nice apartment for a few days (or even weeks) stay in NYC. The apartment itself is exactly as it’s described and photographed and, given its location on 5th Avenue, surprisingly quiet.<br/><br/>The building is nice, with a 24/7 doorman, a good laundry and nice tenants. The location is close to subway and bus lines and, of course, easy to get a cab or a ride share.<br/><br/>Highly recommended"
1657,837536,2021-10-22,"Amazing location, great room options, kind staff at check in. Would recommend and stay again!"

1659,890807,2021-11-14,"The location of this room/apartment is perfect for visiting the north end of Central Park. There is a park entrance just two blocks away! Bill is a responsive host and quickly assisted me with obtaining the keys when I arrived. I did not lounge or cook any meals but there is a couch, dining table for two, and small kitchen in the apartment for shared use with those staying in other rooms. The bedroom had a window air conditioner and closet with hangers for jackets. Overall, it was a good place to sleep and shower and easy to travel downtown and back on the subway."

1662,660840,2021-06-20,Very clean and comfortable place. The host puts a lot of effort into the hygienic aspect.
1663,765406,2019-10-23,The place is in the heart of Queens near the popular neighbourhood of Jackson Heights. It's a small clean room best for a single person. A little small for two people though. <br/><br/>Maria is a nice and kind host. Accommodated my late check in and check out without a complaint. <br/><br/>The public transport is 6 mins walk from the place that pretty much takes everywhere in NYC. The stores and restaurants are all in walking distances.
1664,802949,2020-07-14,over all good jus abit small in side
1665,736796,2021-08-03,"Karilyn, our host, was in communication with us prior to our visit and during our visit. She met us and gave us the key. And anytime I needed something or needed to know I could not find she was available to answer our questions or bring us what was needed."

Had such insightful conversations with Luna's roommate, who is super knowledgeable and helpful :) their dog is the sweetest dog in the WORLD as well as her little turtle friend. The place is beautiful, easily accessible by the subway and about a 30 minute drive to Manhattan, can't recommend enough!"
1668,674242,2021-04-26,"Room is private but all other pictures, including bathroom, are in shared space. Light in stairwell was out so the entry space is a little sketchy. Advertised as non smoking but other guests were smoking, no response from owner."
1669,874794,2021-06-30,"This was super great when I was transitioning  into a new apartment and needed a place to crash for a couple of days. It’s clean, looks exactly like the pictures,  is literally in Midtown (Herald Square) where you can find everything you want. The staff is also super friendly and check in was a breeze! I’m happy"

1688,701297,2019-05-23,El alojamiento en general está muy completo y durante la estadía el anfitrión fue atento. Pero recomendamos tomar fotografías de los distintos ambientes antes de retirarse porque nos acusaron de haber roto algo que no rompimos.
1689,585699,2020-09-05,Great place to stay in Williamsburg. Close to the water and lots of great restaurants.
1690,558774,2019-09-30,"Airbnb is accurately described, a bit of a hostel-vibe, but it’s clean and an ok place to crash. I had an ok first day or so, but actually had to check out early due to screaming and fighting (and children crying) downstairs. I brought this to the host’s attention and he just told me that the family talks loudly and insinuated that I am not respecting their culture. Totally agree that all cultures deserve respect, though I was pretty frustrated at this response, because they weren’t talking loudly, but having a fight, in which children were sobbing and screaming. It wasn’t a great environment to be in. I wasn’t going to leave a review, because it wasn’t the Airbnb hosts fault, but I was so frustrated with his rude response when I tried to offer feedback via DM that it concerned me. I have traveled all over the world and never had to check out early due to feeling unsafe. I wouldn’t recommend this for the solo traveler. It’s a shame, because I like the neighborhood and the building was charming."
1691,331467,2020-09-06,Shosh was a great host! Great at communicating! The house was just as described. The location was busy but if your coming to NYC expect nothing less! I loved the spot overall
1692,841690,2021-09-18,"We loved our stay overall! The host was wonderful and very responsive, and the place had all the necessities we needed.  Our favorite things:<br/>- the location! Perfect walking distance to key places, subway stations (Grand Central was our go-to, which was so nice!) and restaurants/ shops if you need<br/>- the coffee shop just below the townhome! Perk Kafe was excellent and we enjoyed grabbing a quick and delicious coffee every morning before heading out to explore :)<br/>- the home gave us a glimpse into life in Murray Hill :) Small space but very cozy!<br/>- AnnaMarie helped us with anything we needed quickly <br/><br/><br/>A couple of things to note that might be of concern to some (but not necessarily for us):<br/><br/>- the space is very small, so larger groups might not be as comfortable<br/>- very limited closet/ storage space<br/>- only one mirror with okay lighting (we had some trouble with makeup, etc )<br/>- it’s on the second floor, so you’ll want to pack light and make sure you’re able to walk up a few flights of stairs"
1693,889681,2021-11-17,"Acogedor apartamento, ubicado en una zona de fácil acceso y con muchos negocios cerca. Jenny es muy amable y atenta. 100% recomendado."

1697,435360,2020-10-01,"Everything is good! Except the WiFi was died like 4 days. And even I ask him, he didn’t give me a good feedback."
1698,260581,2019-11-02,Merci Yann ! top
1699,165679,2019-10-24,"Rivani's place was wonderful! It was very easy to find and convenient access.  She is highly personable, welcoming, and I felt so comfortable staying with her, having random conversations, and asking for recommendations during my stay. I would love to stay and talk with her again in the future!<br/>Highly recommend!"
1700,360328,2019-10-14,"Shreen's place suited me well, is appropriate with all amenities nearby. I loved her home as quiet & hospitable with two adorable cats. I definitely recommend this place."
1701,851436,2021-06-27,Nice place  I enjoyed my stay
1702,680694,2019-03-12,"We loved this apartment.  It's small, but it's clean and cozy.  The bathroom and kitchenette are new and work well.  (The shower is really nice.) The bed is comfortable for two people.  The location is fantastic.  The West Village has a nice 'neighborhood' feel and there are many terrific restaurants, bars, and cafes within a few blocks.  The subway is also only a few blocks away.  (The apartment is on the third floor and there is no elevator.  We had no trouble with the stairs but people with restricted mobility might find them challenging.). We drove from  Virginia but had no trouble parking on the street within a block or two of the apartment (although we did have to move our vehicle a couple of times to comply with posted restrictions).  Bottom line:  Great value for the money.  We will stay here again next time we're in NYC if it's available."
1703,420992,2019-06-17,"This is my second time staying here, and I would love to stay here every time I visit New York. They're so friendly; it's comfortable and safe, and the animals are sweet, too."
1704,646583,2019-04-29,"Great location. Takes a solid 15 mins to walk the metro and then 35 mins into manhattan, but flushing is a really cool Chinatown and a great place to stay for the price and safe vibe of the area. Room itself is extremely clean, great sized bed and nice amenities, but was lovely to stay somewhere nicely furnished and literally spotlessly clean"
1705,286084,2019-12-13,Nice accommodation with a nice host!
1706,279025,2019-02-19,Beautiful and sunny room with a smart TV and lots of cupboard/hanger space. We would have stayed longer if we could! <br/>His home is nice and clean and we had lots of privacy.<br/>Andres and his friend Diego were wonderful hosts! <br/>His home is of the best value in Queens!!!
1707,530571,2019-10-28,"Great place, great host, and super clean. Easy check-in, good parking, and very private. Exactly what I needed and Monica was a super host. Look forward to my next trip to the Bronx!"
1708,745572,2019-09-06,This getaway was one of THE BEST I’ve taken in awhile. This spot was more than comfortable and located right next to everything you would ever need. Marquiese was a great host he was always able to be contacted. You’d be crazy to miss out on this getaway can’t wait to return
1709,823228,2021-02-22,"The location is perfect, and the house is very cozy.<br/>Just a couple things but for the rest everything was good.<br/>Good host"
1710,582098,2021-02-07,"Highly recommend. Location, listing and host communication were all amazing! Wouldn’t hesitate to book again!"
1711,773240,2019-11-01,"The place is very spacious and well-designed. You will feel very comfortable there. It's very good located and well communicated with other parts of the city. Milton is very responsive and ready to solve any problem that may occure.  He also provided us with all necessary information before our trip, which was very helpful for us.  Moreover, he is very nice person, easy-going and perfect host. I really recommend this place!"
1712,773875,2021-01-16,Anna's place is absolutely beautiful clean and very comfortable.  I enjoyed my stay n even extended it.<br/>The neighborhood has easy access to everything ! Anna is a sweetheart! Thank You For Everything:) I would definatly book this again!! I give it a 10 plus !!!!

1716,687348,2019-08-19,"This place is amazing and Maxime is an excellent host who is there for everything you need, I will definitely come back. It was so clean and close to various subway’s lines. Totally recommend this place!"
1717,702790,2021-11-15,"Matthew was a good host. He communicates as necessary and in a timely fashion.The location of the airbnb was good. Lots of places to eat and a park up the street. It was clean and large enough for two adults - full kitchen, bathroom, LR, and bedroom. I was a little cold but the nice comforter worked well for the nights. Certainly give it a look if that area is where you'd like to be."
1718,582954,2019-10-01,Muy buen departamento y la ubicación sin problemas
1719,299701,2019-06-29,"Can’t get better than this, 5 min from subway station, our the room was clean full of character, it was private with an attached bath, and Diana is generous with her supplies. She keeps little light on so we can find our way to our room. In the past we have stayed at Airbnb before where they keep the lights off, I don’t understand why.. it’s so difficult to find your way in someone’s house without the lights on. Long story short, this is a generous Airbnb, in Brooklyn NY. We recommend it."
1720,750310,2020-01-02,Julie is very nice and helpful. She allowed me to leave my luggage for one more day which did me a big favor. The room is very comfortable. Great place to stay.
1721,698050,2019-11-16,"Excellent place to stay. Very close to the subway station, and a very short commute to where I was working in Manhattan."
1722,397045,2021-10-17,"Alex and Zeena’s place is nothing fancy but it is exactly what you need as a solo traveler staying in NYC. I stayed at the place for a continuing education course, but I have been to NYC several times for leisure. It’s extremely affordable, close to many of the major tourist attractions, next to several public transit hubs, and is clean and quiet. The staff are extremely nice and everyone is generally very respectful. Free breakfast is a plus too. Only downside is one large shared co-ed bathroom, but bathrooms are an issue everywhere in NYC. I highly recommend!"
1723,674080,2019-12-08,"Quick and great communication. Very accommodating. Great local tips. Everything you need in this place- Great kitchen amenities, USB ports on bedside tables, Netflix, very secure place, so neat and clean, stylish. Great place to stay!!"
1724,643916,2021-02-14,"This Airbnb has been the BEST EVER! Vanessa and her amazing husband were incredibly helpful and kind from start to finish! The apartment is beautiful! It smells so lush throughout the entire space and it is warm and comfortable! It is also spotless! You feel beyond safe but also welcomed! Not only is there coffee and bagels, but Vanessa even shared some delicious meatloaf she made with me! How sweet! The shower... oh i could go on for days about it! If self care is your thing, than book immediately, because between the luxurious shower and the provided robe, you’ll be in heaven! The kitchen is fantastic, seriously, big fridge big sink big stove and all the spices you need. I didn’t cook (I’m an order out gal lol) but you could easily prepare a chef’s meal in that kitchen. You have privacy galore and a ceiling fan that made me wonder why all New York apartments don’t have ceiling fans! You are allll the way down the hill but I’m super out of shape and it still wasn’t that bad! I had the best time there and would definitely stay again! When i got caught in the snow storm, Vanessa was so kind to reach out and make sure i was ok. If you’re staying in Harlem, THIS is the place to stay! 10 STARS!"
1725,226106,2019-05-04,Fijn appartement! Metro en supermarkt vlakbij!
1726,685385,2019-08-08,"Place is HUGE.<br/><br/>Super clean and awesome perks. Good work setup, nice kitchen, and chill environment. <br/><br/>Close to food and L train. Definitely worth the value."
1727,847132,2021-05-26,"Host let me leave my luggage early I appreciate it, nice clean room with backyard view, close to L & M trains, only issue was front door lock was tough to unlock spoke to host and he said he would attend to it, I would recommend this stay and host replies fast"
1728,426311,2019-08-10,Amazing place and close to so much! Brett was a great host and showed me around a bit too. Lovely place to stay while I was in town for work. Would definitely stay again and for longer!
1729,849937,2021-07-25,We had a great experience! really quick response from the host as we had to reserve our room the same day. Responded within an  hour even tho it was like 9pm at night when we contacted them.  The room had a nice balcony with a view and very soft bed. So glad we stayed here 
1730,701927,2021-10-24,"A hidden gem in a quiet Bronx neighborhood.<br/><br/>The pictures don’t begin to show the space and function of this 3 bedroom property. Shully’s home is immaculate, the beds and pillows are incredibly comfortable and the space offered plenty of room for 2 families. <br/><br/>A top host, Shully’s went above and beyond to stock basic pantry and fridge items and even saved a parking spot in front of the home whenever we returned from our adventures. <br/><br/>A short 15 minute drive makes this the perfect stay when visiting Fordham, the Bronx Zoo or the Botanical Gardens."
1731,464550,2019-11-20,We were in town for a funeral and were unsure of our plans and they accommodated us when we needed an extra week. They washed the towels and always asked us if we needed anything. Great stay and upper convenient in Coney Island. This will most def be our go to place to stay in Coney. Thanks for a Great stay!!
1732,683525,2020-02-26,Really enjoyed this cool and spacious living space. The pictures truly don't do it enough justice as I was taken away by how large and accommodating the apartment was. More than enough for a solo traveler like myself. The location is ideal for quick access to Williamsburg and within walking distance of all the great places (very convenient location). <br/><br/>Host was always available to answer any questions and looking forward to coming back again.
1733,396110,2021-09-19,Awesome host with two beautiful cats in an exceptional location!
1734,694787,2020-01-10,Goos for a short stay
1735,387532,2020-06-25,"Very well maintained. 5 communication, cleanliness, privacy & tranquility"
1736,577554,2019-05-06,"This was my first Airbnb and I was very pleased with the space. Johan was an amazing host even leaving us a water after a very long day of travel. It’s the perfect sized for a couple or even a few friends looking to stay in an awesome location this is your place!! Many shops just a couple blocks away so if you forget anything no worries   there was a very nice covered patio so in the morning I’d enjoy my tea and listen to the birds. A 30 minute subway ride into the city, like I said perfect location and we can’t wait to come back to johans place!!!"
1737,264260,2019-07-14,"Ming's apartment is in a really booming part of Brooklyn. It is safe, close to many cool shops and restaurants and other amenities (small groceries, Prospect Park, St. Francis Xavier Church, the subway, the bus), and good value for money. <br/><br/>The host is a kind, thoughtful, funny, and helpful person who will surely become your friend by the end of your stay. Ming provided us with all that we needed and beyond! She is truly deserving of superhost status. She was also super accommodating of me when I lost my phone on our last night in New York. <br/><br/>Will definitely come back to Ming's in the future! Highly recommended place."
1738,733502,2019-11-08,"Non fatevi spaventare dall'ingresso: la casa in sé è molto carina, Jack gentilissimo e precisissimo nel dare indicazioni. Il letto è molto comodo e la camera in generale accogliente, la doccia è molto bella. Nell'appartamento ci sono in totale tre camere, se tutte e tre sono occupate potrebbero esserci piccoli disagi con un solo bagno. Ottima la posizione."
1739,206205,2019-11-07,"We had a great stay here—the apartment has an incredible view, had everything we needed, was clean and convenient, and Peter and Travis were great hosts."
1740,639620,2019-07-26,"Awesome place in the middle of the best neighborhood in nyc.<br/>It’s the third time i stayed there, perfect."
1741,642949,2020-01-07,"El lugar está ubicado en un barrio estupendo, con una vibra muy cool lleno de Arte Urbano, bares, tiendas de comestibles de 24 horas y todo lo que necesites está cerca. Desde el metro L es muy seguro y fácil ir a cualquier lugar. Anthony es un anfitrión atento, amable y respetuoso, lugar pequeño pero acogedor. La pasamos estupendo gracias!"
1742,178176,2020-04-29,"I moved to New York on February 15 for a job and needed to stay somewhere temporarily while I looked for an apartment. I chose Steven's place based on the location and reviews. It was more than I expected. Steven was very informative upon check-in and explained everything. The space was big enough for me to cook in and enjoy my time to myself away from the busy-ness of work. Then when the virus hit, I ended up spending all my time there for the last six weeks. I was lucky to be in an apartment during lockdown that was spacious enough to work and live comfortably. Steven was also accommodating to me and worked with me when I had to postpone my move. This apartment is a great place to stay whether you're on vacation or need an extended stay in New York! It is close to many great bars, coffee shops, and restaurants. It is also a few blocks from the subway. I highly recommend it!"
1743,482569,2021-11-28,"The bed is comfortable, privacy with key entry to room was helpful. It was very affordable for a cozy spot to unwind and rest. The location was great, easy to find and very walkable from the subway and some local shops/groceries, restaurants and some nightlife - only a 5 minute or less walk to the N line to get you right into Manhattan, and about a 15 minute drive to LGA. I stayed a weekend and spent most of my time out and about, so this was perfect for my solo journey around NYC. The host was very friendly and welcoming and the space was a nice quiet break from the city. Would definitely stay again."
1744,878952,2021-08-25,spotless and great place
1745,834102,2021-05-31,Great location . Charles was very nice response time was on point. The apartment was more spacious than it looks it was clean and very neat it was a nice quite neighborhood I had a little birthday gathering & didn’t get a complaint at all the host were available at all times through text when I needed to contact them during my stay . I definitely recommend & I will be visiting again soon!
1746,871349,2021-10-23,"I had a great stay at Fraulein’s place. I was very comfortable and the location was amazing, super close to subway and prospect park. There are many good restaurants and supermarkets nearby. Fraulein is also very communicative and kind. Definitely recommend!"
1747,644048,2021-10-22,Awesome
1748,786249,2019-12-07,"This stay was warm, safe, comfortable, and extremely conveniently located for traveling to/from EWR and catching the subway to Manhattan. <br/><br/>Joey’s home is definitely lived-in but the room you’re staying in is immaculately clean and very thoughtfully laid out. There is a place for you to hang clothes, wacky slippers for roaming the floors, a power strip near the bed to charge one’s devices and toiletries in the bathroom if you forgot your own. Probably the first time I’ve done a room stay where I didn’t feel like I had to run to the store every few hours to grab something I forgot to pack. <br/><br/>I also needed assists with a few things and they were so chilled out to accommodate and be communicative. It’s a bit noisy on the street starting around 7am ... city living and all. Probably a good idea to bring ear plugs if you’re a light sleeper. <br/><br/>Dope stay, highly recommend."
1749,857923,2021-11-04,"Cliff’s apartment was the perfect size for my friend and I. Clean, organized, minimalistic. No noise, separate and a secure entrance way— if you’re looking for a quaint stay this place is for you !!!! Thank you Cliff."
1750,775438,2020-05-14,Great location.  Very convenient. Highly recommended!
1751,743419,2021-05-30,Anibal was a great host. He was very attentive and answered all my questions. The place itself was super clean and the view from the terrace was spectacular. I look forward to returning again in the future! Thanks so much for everything Anibal!
1752,807953,2021-04-07,Cute and affordable place. There's tons of restaurants and the train station is a block away. I would definitely recommend! Erica responds as well if you have any questions about the place
1753,503786,2019-10-14,立地が大変良く､部屋もおしゃれでとても良かったです。
1754,886207,2021-11-06,great spot for a single traveler on a quick stay.
1755,72155,2021-09-28,"Amazing place (location, connection with Manhattan, so well equipped, great neighborhood…)  <br/><br/>And communication is great<br/><br/>The place to be !!"
1756,239931,2020-09-21,Amazing to work with
1757,540083,2021-05-28,Nice place
1758,829235,2021-10-20,"Overall an enjoyable stay. The property is small which isn’t really a problem as long as you don’t plan on being there inside much. Check in was very easy. It was not the cleanest of places but you could tell effort was made. Overall seems like it needs a few more items available to feel complete (a few more hooks in the bathroom, a bath mat, a new sponge for dishes, trash bags) but it served it’s purposes for my short stay just fine. Would likely not stay here again unless price was dropped."
1759,359252,2019-06-03,Great first Air bnb experience!
1760,820198,2021-10-24,Good location and quick response times
1761,537942,2019-07-13,"Cute little apartment in the heart of Chinatown. Frances is super speedy with her responses and takes care of anything you might need immediately. My second time staying here, two weeks on each trip. A little oasis in a busy city. I will definitely stay here again. Thank you !"
1762,576110,2019-06-20,Mario is a thoughtful host. He was amenable to storing our bags both prior to checking in and with our late flights at the end of our stay. We appreciated his offer of laundry facilities and providing tea coffee cooking oil etc. The apartment is roomy and spotless. Handy to metro.
1763,844520,2021-01-25,"Worth the value of the room, nice quiet place to spend a few days as needed. Gloria was always quick to respond and help."
1764,775301,2021-08-01,This house is as beautiful as it is in the pictures and is a great value given its location and size.
1765,652904,2019-06-30,"L'appartement est très bien et très bien situé. En revanche, les informations n'étaient pas claires pour l'arrivée (le message concernant un autre appartement). Par ailleurs, le propriétaire rentre régulièrement dans l'appartement durant la journée. Enfin, alors qu'on avait convenu d'un check out tardif lors de notre arrivée, il nous a finalement fallu quitter l'appartement plus tôt que convenu."
1766,629721,2019-07-31,"There is no fan system in the kitchen. Therfore even i cook bacon, the fire alarm has been rallied. And cockroaches was big problem."
1767,849803,2021-02-15,"Honestly such a nice stunning room, it may me small but the amenities and the bathroom make up for up, plus you can connect your Netflix account to your TV!"
1768,577315,2021-05-30,Yves was a great host! His place is close to the subway and very comfortable as a home base. I would stay here again.
1769,692578,2021-05-21,Great place to stay
1770,364118,2019-06-02,"I went as a Solo travel. The area was ok. Subway/train station is about 7-10min walk. The place is in the basement of apt building. For the amount I paid, was a good stay. Building and room smell kinda weird.. but nothing overall okay stay. Great communication, even let me drop my bags off early."
1771,690326,2019-09-30,"Albert and his wife were lovely hosts. We plan to use this apartment again when we are in NYC. Communication and response time were excellent. The apartment is spotless, and very nicely decorated. The location is great for that part of town, and public transit is very close. The coffee and wine waiting for us with a later check-in was also a very nice touch. Thank you for an enjoyable stay."
1772,849066,2021-09-14,Absolutely loved my stay! I definitely appreciated the spaciousness and attention to detail with the interior design! Veronica and Carlos were also super helpful and accommodating. Would certainly stay here again! <br/><br/>Ryan

1775,558488,2019-09-22,The room is very clean and larger than I expect. It is near the subway and bus stations. The neighborhood is safe and quiet.
1776,634047,2019-04-10,"Kevin was an amazing host! I had terrible travel delays and arrived much later in the night than I originally expected, but Kevin was very responsive and helpful in checking me in when I did arrive. The apartment is just a short walk from Central Park, Columbia, and the Subway- I walked or used the Subway the entire time - no need for taxis!"
1777,802620,2021-07-09,"Great apartment close to everything with easy access to the train. You can also visit the local restaurants/ bars or pick up some groceries. I felt very safe in the apartment, everything was kept clean and quiet during my stay. I would stay here again!"
1778,147129,2019-09-10,ありがとう
1779,495572,2021-10-23,"Perfect lodging for the minimalist traveler. It's clean and charming. Good location: a 5-min bus ride or 20-min walk to the 7 in downtown Flushing, which can take you into the city in less than 30 min."
1780,523242,2021-05-15,"This is a lovely space with so many amenities.  It was a perfect temporary home for me while I shift some things in my life.  I was so happy to have a dishwasher, washer/dryer, and outdoor space.  Parking was easy to find, and I could even find space fairly easily late at night the few times I needed to return later.  Interacting with the hosts was always a pleasure, and they were prompt with responses.  <br/><br/>The apartment is about a 10-15 minute walk in one direction to the A train and the other direction to the J train.  The neighborhood is lovely and I would have liked to have had even more time to discover and explore.<br/><br/>Note: This is an old brownstone, so sound does carry.  It means you will hear when the family gets up upstairs, and they can hear you!  Since the hosts do have two small children, you will hear children who are happy that a new day has started.  This is normal for city living."
1781,840381,2021-04-05,"Thanks for the stay! It was a cool, comfortable spot"
1782,713137,2020-10-02,"Place is very clean, tidy and absolutely beautiful. Located in a nice neighborhood. Would definitely recommend!"

1786,581945,2019-10-27,"Exactly what I needed for my stay in Williamsburg, I would say that it's a little dark in here but I won't hesitate to rent it again as it is really well situated and comfortable.  Jermaine was responsive when needed!"
1787,572446,2020-02-24,"There is a Noisy place at night, good location but you share living room with a person whom sleep there, no confortable!! <br/><br/>The stairs are broken and be careful one room have a hot tube close to the bed !"

1790,699146,2019-08-31,"Mikala place is as described with  good view, very bright. Mikala is very nice person, she let us check out late without additional fees. Building and apartment are safe. Neighborhood is weird."
1791,745736,2020-09-13,"Very nice stay with an awesome patio to sit and relax. Host Phoebe was super warm, responsive, and helpful. We had one small mishap, and she was on it immediately to rectify. Definitely want to stay again."
1792,600760,2019-05-27,"Great place to stay in Brooklyn!  Beautiful old home, very comfy and super clean!  It will be my go to place when visiting the area in the future!"
1793,599686,2021-09-13,Great location! Clean and stocked with essentials. Thank you for the stay . I would recommend .
1794,828135,2021-04-13,"Mike was friendly and amenable. His apartment is truly special. Split level, it has outdoor patios, high ceilings, plenty of light, and is very spacious. The photos don't do it justice. The kitchen is well appointed. The apartment is right on a happening street, perfect for dining out and window shopping. It also feels quite safe due to the foot traffic.<br/>You are walking distance to Barclay's center and also the waterfront. <br/>This may not be a good fit for an older or disabled person due to the stairs. There are two flights of stairs to get up to the apartment and one more to get to the bedroom.<br/>The place was very clean with special decor. Cozy furniture.<br/>Two hiccups were that there were (accidentally) only 2 rolls of toilet paper left for 2 guests for a 9 day stay. Though there are shops nearby which sold TP, it felt like something that shouldn't have come out of our pocket.<br/>The outdoor patio spaces are nice but the doors are tricky to operate and lock.<br/>Overall a very nice airbnb. Would definitely recommend and definitely stay again."
1795,558311,2019-10-19,Great place and great people I would stay again!
1796,747939,2021-06-10,"This was the perfect little spot for my 5 days in NYC! Rooms are small but clean, it was just me so it worked out perfectly. Location was great. There is a speakeasy in the basement so it’s pretty loud on the weekend nights but quiets down after 2am. Would definitely stay here again!"
1797,425081,2019-02-18,"Le séjour chez Tony & Grace s’est vraiment très très bien passé. Leur appartement est sécurisé, propre, nickel, on ne peut pas demandé plus pour un séjour. Ce sont des hôtes très attentionnés il n’ a vraiment rien à redire au niveau de l’appartement.<br/>Le seul conseil que je donnerait si vous devez séjourner chez eux, ne faites pas comme moi et lisez bien le règlement intérieur de votre hôte afin de ne pas avoir de malentendu avec l’hôte qui manque beaucoup de tacte. Or mis ce petit bémol mon séjour a été parfait."
1798,887451,2021-09-16,"The apartment was beautiful and exactly what we needed. Very tasteful with a mid century modern twist. It was very close to the subway stations which was amazing! Parking was a little difficult just because we were there on a street cleaning day but we still found a spot! The only thing i found a problem was the bathroom, it wasn’t very clean and still had hair from previous people on the tub which discouraged me from using the shower sadly. But overall it was awesome! Brooke was great and communicative!"
1799,491166,2020-10-25,"This place is a great spot for a solo traveler! Very private and located in a super convenient area, near restaurants, bars, grocery, and the train. The view of the city out the window is so nice and the room had plenty of space for me to chill by myself. Great place for the price, would definitely stay there again."
1800,705231,2020-07-04,Great place
1801,616680,2021-03-03,"Upon check in Raymond was very helpful he even came and checked on me to make sure that I was ok .The space is well worth the price for the stay .The area makes it even better ,& the place smelt amazing ,I felt like I was in a condo .Overall the experience was great ,if you’re a couple I’d highly suggest this place"
1802,794131,2021-06-22,"We had a great stay, the place was very clean, spacious and very convenient as it is close to the subway station."
1803,536213,2021-01-02,Loved this place. The best airbnb place for me
1804,137676,2019-05-05,"Well situated in BK, few min walking from Subway - 25 min to Manhattan."
1805,831019,2021-10-10,"Great spot to stay in Brooklyn. The sweetest couple, super convenient… I got nothing but good things to say."
1806,855454,2021-05-02,Wonderful very clean and comfortable stay! Would do it again. Very welcoming.
1807,858099,2021-04-12,The airbnb its self was nice but During our 5 day stay at this Airbnb wasn’t pleasant. Due to the pandemic I would expect some cleaning supplies despite being the Airbnb was in the basement but luckily we brought our own. It was cold the whole entire time as we were told to use some dingy blankets with lent and hair on it. There were ants and roaches in the bathroom!!! Yet he complained about us talking and laughing when we weren’t loud truthfully for a first stay it wasn’t up to part! Oh and due to the building being old we had to put toilet paper in the trash instead of flushing in the toilet as that’s unsanitary!
1808,546590,2020-09-06,Genuine hospitality and comfort.
1809,737217,2020-08-29,"Great stay, I will definitely stay here again. The bed was very comfortable and the bathroom with the blue light was lovely!"
1810,658730,2021-09-02,"John's place has everything you need for a short stay.  HIs place is close to the airport, Target is 15min away by bus, and several buses nearby to get you to the subway."
1811,832823,2020-11-28,Clean and cozy. Room description was accurate. Angelica was very nice and easy to communicate with.
1812,818703,2021-06-24,Rental is just as described. The host was very friendly and we even got fresh towels in the morning .<br/>Thank you the speedy communication and assistance. <br/>I wouldabsolutely recommend this place.
1813,759472,2019-11-16,Nice house nice host super cute dog!
1814,718173,2019-06-12,"Clean and close to airport with two shared bathrooms. Also we didn't expect free bagels, hazelnut spread and coffee. Was a nice overnight stay. Zahir was also fast in responding to any questions. Thank you!"
1815,699921,2020-03-10,"What a great stay in Brooklyn. This was our first time staying in Brooklyn and this place was amazing. Nice a cozy spot.<br/><br/>A 5 min walk to Prospect Park and Prospect Park station (access to the B and Q) trains. Lots of local places to eat nearby. <br/><br/>The bathtub was amazing and needed, especially after long days travelling in NYC. <br/> Gabrielle is a wonderful host and is easy to get in touch with. <br/><br/>Overall, a perfect brownstone house airbnb and made our trip to NYC even more enjoyable!"
1816,653444,2019-10-22,Nice location with food within walking distance as well as bus stops within walking distance! Space is as described. Works well whether your staying for business or personal reason.
1817,540358,2020-01-14,"Highly recommended accommodation! Extremely clean room and bathroom, but moreover the host was super friendly and accommodating for my late check in. Also Bonissat gave me helpful tips on the neighborhood. As far as the neighborhood goes, it’s also very safe with lots of really good food nearby and supermarkets. Also close to subway stations!"
1818,696044,2021-07-07,Earl was a great host! He always checked on me and made sure I didn’t need anything! Place was nice and remained clean and convenient !
1819,273747,2021-08-31,"Very clean, spacious room, safe and quiet area, and everything from laundry to groceries is less than a 5 minute walk away."
1820,552409,2020-01-02,The host is very nice and its a nice place to stay
1821,473186,2019-08-28,"Very nice location, it’s 5 min walking distance from Katz Delicatessen, Ríe store, Marshall’s, train F. Definitely it’s nice to stay in this apartment. Congratulations"
1822,560326,2019-08-20,Asad place was amazing it was easy to get to lagaurdia airport via uber. I had a friend over and we were able to sit in the sitting area and talk without any disruption from host or other guests. He respects your privacy and lives next door if you need assistance.  Place is secure no need for keys as it's a code entry to rooms.
1823,295073,2019-10-02,"Great location near Times Square. Todd and Eugene were very nice, friendly and kind hosts. Easy to get in touch. <br/>I was able to use the kitchen. Towels and hairdryer provided. Clean apartment.<br/>It was a lovely stay."
1824,623992,2021-11-20,It was a nice place for a 2-week stay.
1825,183360,2019-06-23,Please remember to checkout with a phone call and plenty of thanks or Joseph will call you and tell you off like you are a child.  The house is very clean.  His wife was very nice.  Joseph seemed nasty from day one of calling and giving info.  His exit call was extremely disrespectful for someone paying $470.79.
1826,760624,2019-10-06,The host canceled this reservation 21 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
1827,307346,2021-10-04,"Marie’s home is so beautiful and a true respite from the chaos of a busy day in NYC. Very clean, very spacious, and they were so friendly. Water pressure in the shower was excellent, a/c unit was powerful, and the addition of snacks/coffee/water was exactly what we needed. Great value as well - highly recommend staying here!"
1828,859954,2021-10-20,Good location to stay.
1829,502208,2019-07-04,Ayinde’s Brooklyn Nook was the perfect spot for our family! It had everything we needed and hosting/communication were perfect. Thanks so much!!
1830,510292,2021-10-13,Toby was incredibly attentive and helpful throughout our entire trip. We rented his space last minute and we were easily able to accommodate 9 guests. The place is beautiful and well looked after. Toby would make delicious breakfast and take care of any requests/necessities that our group needed. We would definitely recommend and stay again!
1831,522046,2021-07-18,"Great location, place is clean, everything functioned as expected. The check in process was a bit bumpy but overall good experience."
1832,301363,2019-07-01,GO ! It worth it !
1833,594895,2019-12-08,Perfect stay.
1834,619237,2019-09-09,The host KARA is very kind.  And the location is great.  <br/>It was the best choice for me especially for watching US OPEN TENNIS and sightseeing in Manhattan.
1835,781517,2021-08-10,"Great location, cleanly, and friendly. Would definitely stay here again!"
1836,426328,2021-04-30,"Bretts place was wonderfully cozy and super convenient to the C train for getting around (only a block away.) we loved his personal style and the art which decorates the place. He was also super responsive to our questions and needs, even helping us immediately regain entry to the apartment after we locked ourselves out. The apartment does face a public park which occasionally got loud on the weekends during the day (one time there was a literal marching band hah!) but we actually liked the community vibe of it. Would definitely recommend this one to a couple or single traveler looking to explore a great neighborhood with easy access to Manhattan. Thanks Brett!"
1837,409902,2019-12-16,Nice place with an Brookling atmosphere.
1838,845853,2021-09-23,Todo estuvo muy bien.
1839,856828,2021-10-09,"Filiz is a great host: she is kind and always there if something is needed. Her apartment is amazing: modern, clean and comfortable. The check in was super easy. The neighborhood is perfect and close to my favorite cafes and restaurants. I highly recommend Filiz's place!"
1840,886213,2021-11-21,"Everything I needed, as I planned on being out most of my stay. Perfect location as well!"
1841,879511,2021-08-16,"Fidelis's place was great for our weekend stay  — modern, clean, and conveniently located a block from several subway lines. The space is a small but well-appointed studio apartment with a bed nook and full kitchen. <br/><br/>It's located on a fairly busy street with tons of restaurants, and a small supermarket right across the street. However, it quiets down at night and we didn't have any issues with noise after 9 pm or so. <br/><br/>Communication with Fidelis was also super easy — he was very quick to respond to messages, and he left us some snacks and water bottles, which I thought was a very nice touch."
1842,460975,2020-08-09,"Perfect location in a quiet neighborhood, 30min walk from the beach, plenty of restaurants around. The place is bright and very clean, check in was really easy! The mattress was a bit too soft for my taste but it was perfect for my friends. We had a great experience!"
1843,842134,2021-11-29,"Aleks war sehr hilfsbereit und hat auf jede Nachricht sehr schnell geantwortet. Die Lage von dem Appartment ist sehr gut, wir konnten fast alle Sehenswürdigkeiten zu Fuß erreichen, die Metrostation ist nur ein paar Gehminuten entfernt. Obwohl die Lage so zentral ist, ist es von der Straße nicht laut. Alles in allem ein nettes, kleines Zimmer. Gerne wieder!"
1844,885673,2021-10-06,Ulises was very easy to communicate with. Any thing i needed he was able to provide it . The place is really nice
1845,515897,2019-01-19,Nice host
1846,602678,2021-05-23,"We stayed while we were visiting my daughter. It was super convenient and very comfortable. Great neighborhood, too!"
1847,686959,2019-02-27,"The fixtures furniture etc.  are not new but it’s reasonably clean. There is some peeling paint.  I stayed for 8 hours so bed, shower, gone.  It’s the nyc equivalent of an unbranded motel.  It also not $350/night and it’s super close to Times Square / Penn Station etc.  the location is a bit dark and quiet.  Cab from Penn was $10 w tip."
1848,614981,2020-02-09,"This place is much better than we expected. Super clean and has all the amenities that we needed, Totally recommend it."
1849,200841,2019-11-07,"We loved our stay at Kanae's apartment. Its larger than expected and very close to many cool spots in Williansburg and realy easy access to Manhattan. The apartment was very well equipped for travellers, had USB chargers that was really helpful. The TV had Netflix access, and the bed is really comfortable. Although we did not met Kanae in person she was a friendly host and accessible via (Hidden by Airbnb) ."
1850,890294,2021-11-27,The is the worst airbnb experience I have ever had. The photos they posted online is totally different than the actual setting. The bed is too small for a 5'10 person. They largest bed they have is just a sofa bed which is uncomfortable. The only thing that seperate you and the host is a curtain and so there is no privacy. This can never be a unit for 4 people and it is barely enough for 1 person. Do not recommend! If you really want to stay here please let the host send you the actual vedio of the unit!!!
1851,168561,2019-05-01,Excelente lugar para quedarse en New York. Mario es muy agradable y te hace sentir como en casa. Lo recomiendo.
1852,846431,2021-08-29,"Accommodations, location, and Lisa were all great!"
1853,378721,2020-01-02,"Ben's apartment is super convenient to go any place. It just takes 3 minutes to reach the Metro station. Ben is a very friendly and helpful landlord who helped me a lot during my stay.  What touched me the most was that the day when I leave he helped me lift my two super heavy suitcases off the stairs and took me to the subway station.  Thanks a lot for all his help, and hope to stay in Ben's house next time when I go to New York."
1854,356520,2020-12-07,"The place was immaculate. The pictures do no do this place enough justice. The balcony was bigger than I expected and the apartment was fully stocked with towels, washcloths, toothpaste and toothbrushes. Nice Quiet neighborhood. Andre was more than accommodating. Would definitely stay again."
1855,790883,2021-09-03,"Quiet building/neighborhood. Apartment is a walk up stoop and one floor so beware with luggage. Check-in worked well. Not a shiny, fancy place but the location is great and having a dryer to use after a big rain was nice."
1856,319468,2019-06-22,"Great place, located few steps from times square."
1857,520941,2020-02-17,"Large and cozy private bedroom. Both the bedroom and the shared bathroom were extremely clean. I didn’t use other facilities (kitchen, etc.) so I can’t judge. There are two (quiet) cats around the house. The subway station to reach Manhattan is very close."
1858,250578,2019-12-09,"Great location, easy check in and checkout, needs a deep clean."
1859,868127,2021-09-06,"Nice area with a parking garage across the street (not included w stay, but it was in a convenient location.) <br/><br/>The check-in process was a bit of a hassle—the front desk person told me they could not find our reservation. After having to ask/run around, he told me that although my reservation was confirmed on Airbnb, it was never put into their system by the host. I messaged the host, and did not get a response until about an hour and a half after check-in. I feel like if you’re going to host you should at least be reachable at the time of check-in? Regardless, we were lucky that they actually had a room for us. <br/><br/>The room itself was clean but not in the best condition (paint chipping and peeling off of the bathroom door, AC did not have functional buttons to adjust settings). There was also a HUGE centipede that I had to kill. <br/><br/>They did have a bag check so we could check out and leave our bags, but it’s $2 per bag. Also had ice machines and vending machines available on some floors."
1860,592618,2019-04-28,Eduardo's place was easy to find and was clean. I booked it last minute with no issues. Near two subway stops that didn't take too long to get to the city.
1861,612115,2020-11-08,Best place to stay in rockaway!! Coming back for more! Thanks again Adam we had a blast.
1862,746834,2020-04-24,"Apartment is very homey like, comfortable bed. Everything was clean definitely will book again"
1863,427459,2020-08-30,"A nice place with lovely hosts, both Lei and Bill. Very accommodating. Had some issues getting into the room and Bill was quick to respond and help out with that."
1864,267175,2019-06-15,"Really nice place to stay, full of art details, nice open and inviting space."
1865,769131,2019-10-24,Excellent friendly service. Exceeded expectations.
1866,612659,2020-10-12,Great location by La Guardia
1867,872015,2021-10-23,Amazing stay. Hashi is a wonderful host.
1868,700819,2019-01-26,Great stay great host just a little cold
1869,47309,2021-07-18,"Great location, quiet street and building! Exactly what we expected"
1870,715478,2019-06-12,Took me a while but my stay at Gedan was absolutely amazing and I would definitely recommend it to anyone
1871,300399,2021-09-06,"Ed was a perfect host! He truly makes you feel welcomed in not just his home but neighborhood as well, which he’ll take the time to answer any questions you may have. The room was exceedingly clean, spacious and included a smart TV. Bathroom felt luxurious. An added benefit to Ed’s place is location! Very close to everything you’d need including the subway, definitely check out Manhattanville coffee which is located literally steps away. Outstanding stay, would stay again!"
1872,745578,2019-10-28,"Great spot and great host , no complaints!"
1873,210605,2020-03-20,"Overall great stay. Host was very responsive to questions. The location was ideal, everything you could need is right near by. Extremely good Italian restaurant (nicks pizza) on the same block. Bedrooms were uneven sizes but still comfortable."
1874,852638,2021-05-28,"The apartment description is pretty accurate. The neighborhood is quiet. Though the transportation is not the most convenient, as it's far from the subway, and not close to any major road."
1875,844063,2021-05-20,Courtney's place is so beautiful! It is located right in front of the metro bus and the neighborhood is very safe. Courtney is always there to help if needed and is super friendly! I truly enjoyed my stay there. The bathroom and bedroom are gorgeous and extremely comfortable and clean!
1876,810384,2021-05-20,Nice studio-apartment. Easy access to time square and other touristy areas yet away from the hustle and bustle. We appreciated the extra towels and linens. The bed was very comfortable unlike the sofa bed. So keep in mind it’s better to share the bed if you’re traveling with someone. Check in might seem a little complicated but Marie does very good job explaining it so don’t worry about it.
1877,534419,2020-10-28,"Host communicates well with guests.<br/>Check in was very easy!<br/>Place is convenient, close to the station."
1878,822263,2020-12-17,It was nice
1879,875840,2021-11-08,Hey Guys! Dan and Easton were awesome hosts! The first day the apartment was really cold and I messaged them the next morning and for the rest of my trip I had no problems! Great communication and very friendly! The apartment is so clean and cute! I loved it! Thanks guys!
1880,668365,2021-01-23,A beautiful apartment in a great location!
1881,723507,2019-08-30,"Tiene muy buena ubicación, mas o menos a 2 cuadras del subway AC y a unos 10 minutos del J. Aunque tiene muchas habitaciones, nunca me sentí incomoda. Buen lugar para alojarse unos días en ny. Son muy amables."
1882,886655,2021-09-16,Gary & Liv were A1 host! The place is exactly how it’s photographed. I already recommended to some friends and I will definitely rent with them again!
1883,110212,2020-02-18,Nice place. Clean and great location.
1884,856145,2021-03-18,Filiz was perfect host. I did enjoy my time. And definitely will book the room again.
1885,759344,2019-10-21,"The apartment is clean, the bed is very comfortable, the room has enough space for luggage. The hosts have many cool books about street art, and on the day of our arrival on the TV in the room was playing a wonderful relaxing cartoon (which was very cute). In general, this is a normal option to spend a few days. Guys were very kind allowing us to leave luggage for almost a whole day after the check out.<br/>The main drawback for us was the smell in the apartment (as in the case of cigarette smoking, the old 420 smell is well absorbed into the rooms and the air smells unpleasant despite airing). There is little light in the room (the window is very small, the lamp is dim). And in general this is not the most cozy and homy place to stay."
1886,109165,2019-08-19,"Appartement spacieux purement New-Yorker. Avec ma femme, mon fils (10 mois) nous y avons séjourné 10 jours. Proche de la ligne M qui dessert tout Manhattan (2 stations de Manhattan et 25min de central Park) et à 5 minutes des rues vivantes animées et branchées de Williamsburg. Cet appartement nous a permis de découvrir la vie géniale de brooklyn et plus particulièrement Williamsburg. Je recommande vivement ce logement que vous ayez envie de découvrir Brooklyn ou Manhattan."
1887,502846,2019-07-13,"Joanna's place was exactly as it was described. we arrived early and had nowhere to put our luggage and she let us check in early which was much appreciated. <br/>house was very clean with thoughtful touches and Joanna was very communicative and helpful. great value for money as was out of the busy city but close enough to transport, in a safe area and near shops.<br/>would definitely stay there next time I visit."
1888,221083,2021-08-27,"Tom, the host, was very kind, friendly, and accommodating. The house is large, roomy, and definitely a steal for the price. <br/><br/>The upstairs area can get hot and stuffy, but there is an air conditioner in the bedroom which makes it very comfortable in the NY summer."
1889,87430,2019-11-12,"Très agréable séjour ! Nous étions vraiment bien placés :) <br/>Le métro est juste à côté, c’est super pratique pour profiter de toutes les activités de New York ! Nous avons été très bien :) pour les adeptes de sport il y a une salle de crossfit à 5 min à pied."
1890,631353,2019-06-12,"Appartamento perfetto per i nostri 10 giorni a New York.<br/>Molto vicino alla metropolitana, spazioso e in un quartiere vivo e interessante a Brooklyn.<br/>Shalisa host precisa e puntuale, molto gentile anche quando siamo arrivati un po' in ritardo rispetto all'orario pattuito per il check-in"
1891,606054,2019-08-26,Really great place to stay in Brooklyn. The place looks really similar to the pictures and Phil is really quick to respond.
1892,834198,2021-08-15,"We enjoyed our stay at Cindy's home! We had 9 guests and there was a lot of open space available. We appreciated the easy check in and available street parking. The location is very close to Flushing. The space was clean and Cindy was very responsive when the power went out. Thanks again, Cindy!"
1893,628731,2019-06-18,"Great place, great Soho location. We stayed here with our six and eight year olds, and it worked very well. Close to numerous subway stations. fun neighborhood with tons of shops and eating options, close to Chinatown, Little Italy and more. NYC is great for walkers, and if you would rather walk than Lyft or subway, then within an hour, you can walk to Times Square, Battery Park, Freedom Tower, Brooklyn,... It's just a great location. <br/><br/>Violetta was a wonderful host. She got us breakfast for our first morning there, provided coffee, and checked in via text to make sure all was going well.  We had a few simple questions along the way, and she responded very quickly. All good."
1894,594976,2021-05-28,"Dan is a super responsive and accommodating host, and this is a spacious ground floor apartment.  The kitchen is adequate, and both the livingroom and the bedroom spacious and most comfortable.  When the previous guest broke the Bluetooth speaker, Dan immediately ordered a new one overnight, and the apartment was complete. A perfect stay."
1895,793158,2021-07-01,Great location and place to stay for the value
1896,634672,2019-10-06,"I spent a very comfortable night here while i was in town visiting a friend. Sien is a great, friendly host - he made me feel very welcome,   and made sure that i knew my way around the area, which by the way is awesome. I had a super early bus to catch in the morning and i was worried i'd oversleep. Sien ensured i was up and helped me arrange for transportation."

She did everything she could to ensure my NYC trip was as easy and and as enjoyable as possible. <br/><br/>The apartment was very clean and tidy and has everything you need for a short trip. <br/><br/>The area is a little rough around the edges at first appearance, but has great amenities close by, and is a great place to set out from, either on foot/bike or via numerous subway lines nearby. <br/><br/>I would definitely recommend staying at Patricia's place if you're visiting NYC and plan on spending the majority of your time in Brooklyn. <br/><br/>Thanks, Patricia!"
1905,120027,2019-04-07,Ruth is a very kind host and was so accommodating when my arrival time was unexpectedly delayed by 3 hours.  The space was clean and inviting to come home to each evening after busy days in NYC. Great food options in the neighbourhood too!

You can count on them.<br/>Bottom line: Perfect place to stay.<br/>Thank you Steve!"
1908,834440,2021-04-19,"My friends and I enjoyed our stay in Vilmas home. It was very clean, quiet, and wonderfully furnished. The neighborhood is amazing. The location provided me and my friends with an opportunity to explore, shop, and eat at the various stores just minutes away by foot. I would highly recommend Vilmas home to anyone looking for a comfortable stay. <br/>The only con, there is very limited parking in the area, public trans is best. <br/><br/>I hope to stay in Vilmas home again."
1909,795276,2021-04-05,"I think this is one of the nicest places I have stayed in Park Slope.

1925,306617,2019-10-31,"Charming space in a great and convenient location in Brooklyn. Small bathroom with a slightly awkward sink, but fully functional in every way. We were able to make use of the kitchen to make small meals to save money. Great stores and restaurants very nearby. Our only gripe is that the bed, while comfy, has a mattress that sags in the middle, making it less comfortable for two people. Located in an awesome neighborhood, and only a couple blocks away from the subway."
1926,710308,2019-04-04,Lovely and great home would book anytime

1928,613645,2019-10-02,"This is a really great place, bedrooms are super roomy, especially by New York standards. There’s grocery stores close by and the apartment’s kitchen facilities were just right for making breakfast in the mornings, after which it’s just a quick walk to the subway or Mccarren Park. The place was so clean, everything looked brand new but be prepared to lose some time looking at all the lovely vintage books and objects that decorate the place."
1929,113916,2019-11-24,"Ron is a great host, super hospitable, stylish place & just a few blocks from the A C E train. It was the perfect place to stay for the weekend for a concert & I’d 100% recommend this for anyone wanting to stay in NYC without breaking the bank! Great stay, thanks Ron!"
1930,98607,2019-10-26,"My husband and I stayed at Amy's place for 4 weeks while working in the city. It was everything we could have wished for. Quiet space which was close to the subway and bus lines, lots of cool things to do, and walking distance from great food, the neighborhood felt very safe.  The apartment itself was HUGE with the biggest and most relaxing bathtub I've ever seen. We had everything you might need/want to survive in the city for a day or a month. I would recommend this place to anyone."

1933,525528,2020-12-17,"The minute I opened the door to The Brooklyn Penthouse I knew I'd  made the right choice. Jaime has put so much love and care and thought into this wonderful apartment; it was just as cozy and charming as it looks in the photos. Everything is provided; you really don't need to bring much. There's even a cake mixer if you're so inclined! And Jaime made me feel so welcome, even before my arrival. We both had a bit of extra time for a lovely little walk on 6th Avenue one night, and I was so happy to have had the chance to spend some time together as by then we had become friends. The neighborhood is great, just a couple of blocks from Park Slope, and a few avenues from Prospect Park, with lots of little shops and restaurants close by. I'm so happy to have found this perfect spot in Brooklyn. Thanks Jaime!!"

1942,499147,2019-05-17,位置很不错的民宿，房主非常热情，而且非常非常干净！ 每天都看到房主再清洁，他们很爱护自己的房子，入住很放心！很适合去那里想买点中国货或者剪头发等的华人入住，附近很多华人餐厅超市和杂货店，美容美发等等，非常方便。
1943,795897,2019-12-28,The place was great!

1948,565251,2021-10-06,"Karina's place was really cute, and all the spaces were pretty clean. Our room was very spacious, and Karina provided everything we needed. It's close to a bunch of shops and restaurants, and most of the subways are within a 10 min or less walk. The area can be a bit loud at night, but the bedroom is away from the street so you don't hear much of the noise. Karina was very friendly and helpful, and we enjoyed our stay with her. Highly recommend!"
1949,576659,2021-02-04,Amazing host. Easy to find parking and the house is nice and clean.

1951,812599,2021-05-20,"Great spot to stay in the nicer and less crowded part of Williamsburg.  Still in the heart of the hood and right next to the L but on a quiet street for those that might want to catch some rest at some point.<br/>Place was cute and clean and Emmanuel was accommodating and responsive.<br/>Thanks, would recommend easily!"
1952,705225,2019-10-05,"If you are claustrophobic, this place is not for you. If you like to sleep a little late, this place is not for you unless you don't mind risking the other renters making noise early in the morning. If you have a sensitive stomach, and need to use the bathroom this place is not for you. But we must say that as ordained ministers that came here from Florida on an emergency. Our son was mugged and left to die. Rafael's place was heaven Sent. We got to pray for the other renter's. One of the gentlemen was getting eye surgery. It was very close to our grandchildren that live in Astoria. Rafael was very informative and last minute added a twin bed to the room we rented. I must say that although this was our first Airb&b experience,and now we know and will book what we want and need. Rafael's l place did not  exceed our want, but due to our emergency it exceeded our need. We thank Rafael for his accommodations. If we ever needed to stay again, we say yes..we will. Thank you Rafael, thank you for the waffles, coffee etc..  It is a cozy place. Use your own judgment. Thank you, Rafael. May our Lord Jesus bless you and your family. Rev. James & Rev. Evelyn H."
1953,449885,2021-08-18,"Jonathan has no courtesy for female or solo-travelers. I was threatened to change my reservation with no explanation at 11:00 p.m. or he would vacate me immediately in the middle of the night. I brought a friend over ONE day and Jonathan scammed me into paying guest fees for SEVEN days. When I nicely asked Jonathan for clarification he refused to explain and instead used scare tactics and unprofessionally stated, ""its business.""   <br/><br/>Due to being threatened and scammed into paying fees that simply did not apply to my stay, I decided to depart early. I refuse to stay in a hostile environment and do not tolerate scammers/grown men who use scare tactics on women knowing they are traveling alone and in a new city. <br/><br/>I do not recommend staying here."
1954,831560,2021-04-21,"A great place to get ready for the day with hot water and all the tools you need for food and coffee. After a long day, it's perfect for relaxing with comfortable couches, a peaceful back yard, and a bed comparable to a soft cloud."
1955,889216,2021-10-24,"Katie was a great host, the place was very nice and comfortable, everything I needed was at an arms reach and if I needed anything else Katie was always ready to answer any questions. The location gives you many different activities and things to do and places to eat from and with the addition of Prospect park the amount of things you can do are endless. Don’t forget about Huck, he’s such a nice cat, very polite and welcoming! Overall my experience was great and I would do it again!"

1973,308137,2020-08-21,"The entire experience was perfect. The cottage was modern and sparkling. The neighborhood quiet and serene. And the restaurants, a few blocks away, all had wonderful fresh seafood (Prices much less than Manhattan)."
1974,593860,2019-06-01,"Jennifer’s apartment is really nice and clean, she is a really kind and warm hearted person who will always make you feel welcome. I’m really thankful with Jennifer and her family for making me and my husband feel really comfortable in her apartment. Amazing vibe, you will feel in peace, and the apartment is always clean. The neighborhood is really nice as well, there’s a park really near, full of families and now that’s almost summer you will see a lot of life, kids playing, families gathering for bbqs, etc. The train is really near, about 2 blocks and a half From Jennifer’s apartment, highway and other public transportation available in the area as well. There’s plenty of restaurants in the area, with so much variety of flavors, from boricua and Dominican food, to some Mexican and Chinese as well, frozen yogur spots and of course some American McD as well, you can cook at Jennifer’s place, the only thing she asks you is to clean the kitchen and your dishes, which is totally fair. If you need to wash clothes, there’s a couple of laundromats around the area, and with less than 5 dollars you can wash and dry enough clothes, I think there’s machines on the basement too. Overall,  I totally recommend Jennifer’s place. <br/><br/>////////////<br/><br/>El apartamento de Jennifer es realmente agradable y limpio, ella es una  persona muy amable y de buen corazón que siempre te hará sentir bienvenido. Estoy muy agradecida con Jennifer y su familia por hacer que mi esposo y yo nos sintiéramos realmente cómodos en su apartamento. Ambiente increíble, te sentirás en paz y el apartamento siempre estará limpio. El vecindario también está muy bien, hay un parque muy cerca, lleno de familias y ahora que es casi verano, verás mucha vida, niños jugando, familias reuniéndose para barbacoas, etc. El tren está muy cerca, aproximadamente a 2 cuadras y medio desde  el apartamento de Jennifer, la autopista y otros transportes  tambien están disponibles en el área. Hay muchos restaurantes en la zona, con tanta variedad de sabores, desde comida boricua y dominicana, hasta algunos platos mexicanos y chinos, yogurt congelado y, por supuesto, también algo de American McD; puedes  cocinar en el lugar de Jennifer, el único detalle que ella te pide es que limpies la cocina y tus platos, lo cual es totalmente justo. Si necesita lavar la ropa, hay un par de lavanderias en el área, y con menos de 5 dólares puede lavar y secar ropa suficiente, creo que también hay máquinas en el sótano. En general, recomiendo totalmente el lugar de Jennifer."
1975,700123,2019-03-30,Recomiendo  100% este alojamiento ya que el anfitrión es de lo mejor

1977,412572,2019-04-25,Kaitlyns place is accurately described by her. Things to not for me were.  A great shower with room to move in! A very comfortable bed and bedroom. A short walk to Graham Avenue which was handy for me personally. A neighbourhood that is rich in places to eat and close to subways for access to Manhattan. Kaitlyn is a friendly host who makes your stay comfortable and easy.
1978,451471,2019-12-06,"Ania's place is in an excellent location. It is quiet, the bed is super comfortable and she was available for any questions. Definitely recommend and thank her for a wonderful stay!"

1993,721833,2019-04-19,Jason and his crew were absolutely awesome and super hospitable. The access was pretty easy and the whole flat was clean. Every evening we spent couple of hours w such a nice life talks so I simply though we know eachother for centuries. They gave us lots of “must see” tips and were on the phone always we needed some assistance (and I’m a blondie so u can imagine it was quite often-).<br/>Maybe there is the only one thing you have to be aware in their place: quite sensitive fire alarm in the kitchen :-D <br/>Love you guys! Hope I’ll see you once again. <br/>XOXO to all of you and especially to Richard ♥️<br/>#magnoliaqueen
1994,798745,2021-03-07,"Awesome location, a few issues, but ultimately a good stay."
1995,555563,2019-12-14,"We had such a great experience at Erin's! Her place is clean, big, and in a perfect location. Erin was really easy to communicate with and was extremely hospitable. We'll definitely be back!"
1996,614984,2020-02-24,"Win is the best host ever. His place is cozy and clean. Definitly, I’ll stay here next time."
1997,705133,2021-09-22,Very clean room. Rosy was friendly. I got in semi-late (8 pm ish) and left before anyone got up (4 AM). Very close to the airport and was easy to get an Uber.  I would stay with her again.
1998,865579,2021-07-11,This place is amazing.  The location is perfect for anyone trying to see NY. It is close to port authority and there are so many restaurants near by. The hotel is the perfect getaway from the busy outside street. Very clean and comfortable. Would definitely visit again
1999,665000,2021-03-09,"Beautiful place, smaller than what the pictures looked like but it was great!"
2000,611628,2019-07-30,"Paula and Dean are amazing hosts. They are so accommodating and friendly. In today's fast world to find such a clean, full of amenities and private room near JFK location is a blessing. Even though the neighbourhood for some might be questionable as some of Uber drivers I had during my stay were reluctant to drive around in alleys near the house, but this is purely a stereotype human race has these days which needs to be shredded. I lived here and can vouge for it that it was completely safe to call uber and drive around even at night and everyone around was very friendly. I would definitely recommend this place to others as this place has everything as listed and even better I must say. The Green acre mall, JFK airport, train station everything is literally 10 minutes drive away.<br/>Paula was very kind and helpful throughout the communication and although my stay was limited to one night only but that was worth a peaceful stay in such a clean house."
2001,349209,2021-03-01,"It was a wonderful stay from start to finish. The check in was convenient and the apartment was a delight to behold from the beginning. It was neat and tidy and required amenities were provided. It was easy to make ourselves at home here. The neighborhood is friendly and safe with a good choice of restaurants, pharmacies and laundromats all a two to ten minute walk away. Joseph himself was kind enough to accommodate certain requests we had and it added to the comfort of our stay. On the whole, it was a great experience and I would definitely recommend staying here."
2002,803892,2021-05-01,Nice stay. Thanks
2003,820631,2020-10-17,"This is a very centrally located airbnb, near to the trains and many attractions. Good value!"
2004,30602,2019-01-13,"The location and value are both fantastic, the lodging is nice but also pretty straightforward, perfect if you don’t plan on spending a lot of time relaxing and are on the go. The building seems to be having work done while we were there so unfortunately we were subject to hearing a lot of that during our stay but based on all other reviews that seemed to just be specific to our stay. I wouldn’t hesitate to say here if you’re considering it."
2005,554929,2020-03-03,Less than a 5 minute walk from one of the subway stops on the 6 train which made this room very convenient to stay at. You pay for exactly what you get here which I think is a steal considering that it’s in Manhattan. We only planned to use this air bnb as a place to sleep at night which it was absolutely perfect for. Elliot also responded very quickly which was great. He let us keep our suitcases in the room past our checkout time before our flight out of NYC which was really nice of him. It got down to the low 20s and the heat was on which made for a very cozy stay. The use of the fridge and microwave let us easily keep leftovers and heat them up as meals or late night snacks later. Overall our stay here was amazing!
2006,700560,2021-09-26,I had a great stay at Natalia's. It was clean and as described. I loved seeing the vegan books in her collection and her crystals! I was traveling in a car and had trouble finding parking but luckily Natalia responded quickly with areas that might have spots available that were a few blocks away. The lock to the apartment is a little tricky. You have to pull the door closed and gently insert the key to lock it properly. You can hear the people above but it is to be expected in an old home. Just an FYI so travelers know what to expect. Thanks for the stay!
2007,624569,2019-05-27,This place is really awesome and I would highly recommend it. I will definitely come back.
2008,480577,2020-09-13,Very nice and clean apartment really close to the beach and the host was very accommodating

2010,702774,2021-03-08,"This airbnb is located in a very convenient location in Bushwick. Everything you need is within a short walk away. The entrance itself is very secure and instructions the host gives are very clear. When you walk in,  you are met with a very open concept space and tall ceilings with skylights. Everything in the unit worked as expected during my stay. The bed was comfortable and has a lot of natural sunlight in the mornings. I would highly recommend this spot to anyone that is looking for a spot in the Bushwick area or working/rotating at Wyckoff hospital."

2019,624008,2021-11-20,"My mom and I had a great stay at Zackery’s place! Directly across the street from a beautiful park with old trees and walking paths meandering through- was an excellent place to unwind.  Located on a quiet (for New York) residential street we felt very comfortable. The apartment has a fresh, clean look and was warm and cozy, with very comfortable beds.  Only a three block walk to the nearest subway stop, and a short ride to Manhattan.  Be sure to check out nearby Mottley Kitchen for baked goods and healthy eats, recommended by our host- it did not disappoint!   We will definitely book here next time we come to visit!"
2020,347934,2019-03-15,"This is the perfect base camp for exploring the city. Lots of nice touches. Many amenities above and beyond what’s expected. If it’s available, book it!"

2035,263420,2019-12-14,"We stayed for one week! It’s a great apartment in a lovely neighborhood! We loved it!

2039,795470,2021-09-08,It was great staying here. Larrisa was very responsive to our messages and made things so easy for us when checking out. I would definitely stay here again when going to New York. Our one week stay here may it feel like we were home.
2040,38986,2019-10-27,"I stayed at Carol’s apartment again.<br/>The bed had been replaced with a new queen-size bed, which was very comfortable.<br/>Carol is as friendly, considerate and helpful as ever. When we met in the apartment, we had a chat about the museum, the musical and the restaurant I had experienced that day; about traveling abroad and so on. This made my stay more pleasant.<br/>This time again, I enjoyed my stay very much. Thank you, Carol."
2041,569852,2019-09-15,"Houman’s home was a lovely and inviting. It was a great place for my weekend get away. Short walk to great restaurants, coffee, and shopping. Easy to get to from JFK and easy access to the MTA and bus. As a single woman, I felt safe staying there and walking in the neighborhood, even when checking-in later in the evening. <br/>I would definitely want to stay again on my next trip to the city."

2048,433146,2019-11-30,"Tim’s place was perfect for our New York adventure. The layout and space allowed us to gather as a group or allow some space to escape alone. The location was great: close to a ton of great parks, cafes and restaurants. We could stay local or hop on the nearby train to explore the city. He was also a swift communicator and very helpful."
2049,816215,2021-11-28,"Amazing place,great location,who is familiar with NY knows what i am talking about.House is spotless clean,everything is as described and the private rooftop terrace  is a cherry on top .

2052,581539,2019-07-14,"Claire and John’s home is in a gorgeous Brooklyn neighborhood, very convenient to the subway and many local restaurants and shops. We enjoyed wandering around the neighborhood and even stopped by a few Saturday yard sales on their street! We felt very safe in the area and it was the perfect location to attend a friend’s birthday events nearby. <br/>The room was the perfect size for the two of us, and we loved the thoughtful snacks and drinks that were left in our room. Everything really worked out well all weekend and I will definitely keep this place in mind if I need a room in Brooklyn in the future!"

The check in / check out process was very easy. Frances was able to accommodate us for a somewhat late check in due to our flight time.<br/><br/>The neighborhood felt very safe and was quiet all night. Closest subway station was a short walk away and there are plenty of great options for food just down the street.<br/><br/>Would definitely stay again!"

2078,708124,2019-10-23,"Ana was very helpfull, she checked in with us everyday. Her home is better than expected. Is located in a typical NY latino area. There are 3 staircases  to go up. Ones inside the apartment everything was clean and smelled nice. Several metro lines going to south ferry and downtown available around the corner. Would stay here again. Save to book."

2081,842842,2021-01-09,"The space is beautiful and fresh and very trendy, it feels like more than what you pay for, and it’s conveniently right by the metro. The doors are a bit tricky to open because they’re old NYC doors but that was the only downside. If I could buy this apt I would"

Great location right next to the 1 train, several restaurants and grocery stores. Beautiful Inwood Hill Park only 15 minute walk away. Bertha was very kind and provided everything I needed.

2088,851542,2021-09-01,"The host was very responsive and accommodating. This listing is just as described in the pictures. Every amenity is available and works. the location is great. You can order takeout easily or purchase fresh fruits or supermarket supplies at a nearby ALDI supermarket. The area is very safe, there is also a digital video/audio camera located on the front window of the living room provides added security. Would recommend this place for a family stay. There is also a beach within walking distance ."
2089,751422,2019-06-28,"Her place was amazing comfortable and convenient. I will most definitely recommend and will love to stay again.

2090,817885,2021-07-11,"Would 100% recommend! It’s only 30 mins driving to get to the center of Manhattan, spacious, you have a private entrance and free parking in the driveway just steps from the door , not even a block away from a supermarket, diner, gas station and Dunkin’! and most importantly is dog friendly! I brought my pittie along and he loved walking around the area. This place is worth every penny and the host (Kiki ) was great , she would always respond to any questions or concerns I had , keeps the place in sparkling clean condition and was very accommodating with us about check in time. Thank again !!"
2091,628836,2020-05-15,Was amazing and so helpful!
2092,598403,2019-04-30,"Rebeca war eine sehr nette und hilfsbereite Gastgeberin, die schnell auf unsere Nachrichten geantwortet hat. Die Unterkunft selbst ist sehr schön und sauber mit ausreichend Platz und guter Ausstattung.<br/><br/>Es muss einem allerdings bewusst sein, dass die Lage der Wohnung nicht optimal ist. Es gibt zwar ein paar nette Lokale in Gehdistanz, ansonsten hat das Viertel jedoch nicht wirklich etwas zu bieten. Der Weg nach Williamsburg oder Manhattan dauert ziemlich lang (zum Central Park ist man zB circa 45 Minuten mit der U-Bahn unterwegs, mit dem Auto kann das locker über 1 Stunde dauern und über 60 Dollar kosten; auch nach Williamsburg ist man mit dem Auto circa 20-30 Minuten unterwegs, Kosten für Uber circa 20-35 Dollar). Man muss sich daher darauf einstellen, dass für Uber/Lyft/oä beträchtliche Kosten anfallen können. (Das ist natürlich nicht die Schuld der Gastgeberin, wir hätten uns schlicht besser informieren sollen. Auf der Karte schauen die Distanzen einfach nicht so weit aus.)<br/><br/>Fazit: Die Wohnung an sich ist wirklich schön, vor allem für den Preis. Wer mit der Lage kein Problem hat, ist dort bestimmt super aufgehoben. Wir würden das nächste mal wahrscheinlich lieber mehr für die Unterkunft zahlen und dafür zentraler wohnen."
2093,301532,2021-05-18,"Peter and his place are great. He was very friendly, accommodating and quite easy going which made the whole process very low stress . The trashcans were all empty and clean towels were ready to go, the place was very clean. The apartment is a short walk from time square and the subway, and there were some nice local restaurants: ""Mom's"" was a fun breakfast. It was really nice to be in a lived in space, compared to a hotel, over all this was a great value."
2094,641319,2019-07-03,"Very convenient to the city, on-site parking is definitely a plus. I will consider staying here again."

2104,758078,2019-09-29,"My husband and I stayed at Ame’s apartment with our 2 young daughters for a weekend. It was the perfect place to stay!

The apartment was clean, cozy, and stylish. Thanks Ame!"

We were visiting to help move our daughter and so after a hard days work it was great to go back and rest at her place. We would stay again when we have more time for sightseeing!
2106,826196,2020-11-15,Great apartment in good location! Jorge and Laura were very responsive
2107,269117,2021-03-29,His apartment was great. Roula was a great host. The beds were comfy and there were lots of amenities like apples and candy. The parking was easy and the neighborhood was wonderful. I would definitely stay there again next time I come to Astoria.
2108,18815,2019-09-14,"Un alojamiento bien comunicado con el centro.<br/>No hay aire acondicionado, pero lo suplen unos ventiladores en los techos."
2109,584488,2019-08-04,"The house is amazing. Love the location, especially for tourists who want to explore Brooklyn. The place is super clean and have all kinds of utensils."
2110,835779,2021-08-15,The apartment is in a great location and is exceeded my expectations for an apartment in NYC. I sáltales for two months and had no issues with the apartment other than the size of one of the bedrooms (which is to be expected from an apartment in New York I guess). All around I had a good stay and would book the apartment again in the future!
2111,807021,2021-09-19,"Susan's place is an absolute delight. The location is perfect, the space is whimsical and thoughtfully outfitted, and we spent most of our weekend up on the private roof deck. This place is a rare find as far as AirBnBs go. They were very accommodating and communicative hosts. 10/10 would recommend!"
2112,872099,2021-09-27,"As a former Bushwick resident, this was a great stay; right in the heart of the neighborhood, walking distance to everything. Steve was very accommodating."
2113,88206,2019-03-23,"Het was super fijn om in het appartement te verblijven! Een ontzettend leuke buurt met veel leuke tentjes waar je kunt eten. Ontbijt bijvoorbeeld bij Five Leaves (beste pancakes!) en diner bij Cherry Point. <br/><br/>Peter was super gastvrij en reageerde ontzettend snel. Daarnaast had hij allerlei lokale tips waar we bijvoorbeeld lekker konden eten en boodschappen konden doen. Het appartement zit in een alternatief gebouw is samengesteld door de bewoners. Een unieke ervaring en het uitzicht is top! <br/><br/>Ben je erg lang? Let dan wel op het bed, want die is een beetje aan de kleine kant:)"
2114,791516,2020-10-28,This place was the same as pictured.
2115,684702,2019-10-21,"Lucy is an excellent host and I recommend her home for a short or long visit. Using Alexa was a nice touch for music and the location is  prime. Thanks again, Lucy."
2116,621115,2021-11-26,"The apt is beautiful, just like the pictures. Location is convenient and the bed is very comfortable. We’d love to stay at Kemar’s again."
2117,724335,2019-11-11,"I never met Constance in person, our communication was via messenger and very friendly. All instructions were detailed,  no problems with the keys. The room size is ok, advice: it would be great to have some space to put/hang cloths. I have chosen the Appartement because of the location, since I had an event close by. Unfortunately I was very disappointed by the cleanliness of the apartment, especially bad and kitchen (fridge!). This is the reason I would not come back."
2118,561846,2021-11-05,Very nice and peaceful
2119,693808,2019-12-15,"A stylish place, easy access to metro and lots restaurants and bars. Helpful and lovely host."
2120,716159,2019-06-19,"Nice/safe neighborhood. The place looks how presented in photos. Just what we needed for our trip to sight see the city. Besides the near impossible parking and there being a mouse in the place, it was overall a great stay."
2121,684972,2019-10-11,We really enjoyed stating at Ramon's apartment in Brooklyn.  It's a very homey and comfortable space and we felt right at home.  The location is great and it's easy to get around the city on the subway from his place.  We'd definitely stay here again if we come back this way.
2122,539792,2019-03-28,Great Place Very Private Calm Neighborhood Not Noisy Very Quiet Would Only Suggest A Tv Being Apart The Place Too But WiFi Were Provided And The Connection Was Great All In All Great Place To Book.
2123,152254,2019-04-25,"Mira e suo fratello Pierre sono persone fantastiche, molto disponibili. L'appartamento è a 2 minuti dalla metropolitana e a 15 minuti da Manhattan. Io e mia figlia ci siamo trovate benissimo."
2124,326347,2019-09-04,"Clear instructions, very responsive."
2125,529838,2021-01-08,Host was amazing and everything was great
2126,511593,2019-01-31,"Johny’s place was clean, beautiful and comfortable. We had everything we needed and nothing was lacking. It exceeded our expectations and more. Thank you again for everything. My mom and her sisters had a very great time and are all very happy."
2127,745638,2019-12-20,"This place was great for what my friend and I needed. Steps into apartment are a little steep but they presented no problem for us, but for future notice to others. Beverley was there when we arrived and gave us a tour and was so nice. Made arriving on a rainy, cold day totally stress free. Subway is only a 10 min walk. It was in the teens at night and we were warm and cozy all 3 nights of our stay. Everything was clean and comfortable. We would stay again!"
2128,758653,2019-12-02,"This is a great place, clean and spacious, plus in a fantastic neighborhood.  A block from G train and a quick walk to L train. So many great choices for food in the neighborhood. Our host/Ashley was very helpful and available if we needed her. This is the perfect spot for a family to stay."
2129,698284,2020-07-03,Perfect
2130,481826,2020-08-24,"Amazing place, would definitely come again"
2131,49044,2021-05-05,Great host! Very communicative. Great accommodations. Couldn't have been happier!
2132,874450,2021-09-26,"The place is cute, clean and affordable. We enjoyed our stay!"
2133,694801,2020-02-19,"Lakshmee was kind, easy to reach, & quick to respond to any questions. The room is pretty much as described & very clean; it is an easy stop over for JFK. I arrived in the early evening & left very early, so I didn’t explore the area much, but I never felt unsafe despite traveling alone. I recommend staying here for JFK layovers/early flights & will stay here again if I have another early flight!"
2134,760905,2020-08-01,I LOVED IT. Can't praise this spot enough.
2135,74330,2019-08-02,"Page was a lovely hostess, I had an injury while staying and she was so helpful!"
2136,120033,2019-05-20,"It’s a great room in a great location.  Clean and comfortable.  We felt safe and slept well.  We used the bed as well as the air mattress and were quite comfortable.  We were able to walk to Central Park, museums, restaurants and subway terminals.  And, there’s a Starbucks right around the corner!  The room gave us the feel of actually living in NYC for a few days instead of just being a tourist.  Highly recommend it!!!"
2137,709003,2021-11-28,"Definitely enjoyed my stay in Ty’s place. The space is just as advertised with even a few recent upgrades, it was a very comfortable stay. Ty was also a very accommodating host, of service and goes the extra mile for his guest. Definitely worth its value."
2138,715249,2019-11-10,"Super cozy, comfortable and spacious! Veronica’s place was exactly as pictured. We had a great stay and celebration for my 30th birthday. Definitely recommend!"
2139,786664,2021-09-06,"This loft is exactly as described.  It is rustic and funky and you definitely won't find anything else like it!  It is in a perfect location, with access to two different subway lines within easy walking distance.  Two really good coffee shops less than a block away, markets, parks, close to the river, grocery store.  And it is quieter here than in other parts of the city.  I spent 3 weeks here with my two teenaged children and we loved it.  Would definitely recommend and will likely be coming back ourselves. James was very quick to get back to us, even when we texted him one night at midnight for an emergency when he was out of town and he got back to us almost immediately."
2140,457505,2019-06-02,"Amy’s place was very enjoyable and  conveniently located to the subway and lots of restaurants. The room was large enough for two people to function comfortably and the bathroom was big!   Though this wasn’t our first visit, I appreciated that prior to our arrival, Amy provided a comprehensive guidebook for the room, as well as the neighborhood, subway navigation, and city attractions. Additionally, Amy communicated very well and was responsive to any questions and concerns we had. My only criticism of this place is that guest Did not have the ability to control the temperature in the room. Throughout our stay it was warm and stuffy, which made for a very uncomfortable sleeping, as we normally have the temps at home cooler at night (even with cooler outside temps) . Amy informed us that the air is normally turned on in June and that a window could be opened to allow in cooler air. The only drawback; it rained three days that we were, there was the occasional street noise from cars or others walking by (this is ground level rental), when we did open the window tiny flying bugs would enter, and it simply offered no privacy (everything could be heard from the room if the window was open). Overall, we appreciated the hospitality!"
2141,532944,2021-09-01,"Dora is a wonderful host. She was very helpful and responsive when I had requests. The space was thoroughly cleaned for me so when I arrived, I felt comfortable about my choice."
2142,817325,2021-08-09,"Will and Sarah were fantastic. They were helpful whenever we had issues, and the apartment is a great place for a NY stay."
2143,835857,2020-12-27,"As advertised, the listing was great and one of a kind around the city. Oswaldo and co. were very helpful and made things convenient throughout my stay."
2144,626060,2021-11-18,Great stay everything as described and easy check in. Thank you
2145,521512,2019-05-30,"All good. Clean, affordable, privacy and good communication with the host. I would recommend. Thank you Shuly!"
2146,787400,2021-10-10,"Super cute cozy studio, indeed! Check in was a breeze and the place was super clean with a comfortable bed and a spacious bathroom (which I loved!). Kitchen was stocked with necessities for cooking and dining in. I enjoyed the wine bottle and I was able to make coffee every morning! Laura stocked up water bottles and other beverages in the refrigerator and I thought that was so nice. There's a water filter though if you prefer not to use water bottles (I drink a lot of water so it's a bonus for me when places have water filters!). There were plenty of towels for use and a cute table roomy enough to eat and work on. The area felt safe and quiet away from the bustle of the city... metro was about a 15 minute walk- not too bad!!! There are plenty of restaurants in Astoria if you wanted to stay in the area, I recommend Burger Club and Hinomaru Ramen. I didn't have a car but there's a parking spot for you which is rare in NYC! Overall, it was a great stay for a super reasonable price! Thank you, Laura!"
2147,718324,2020-10-17,Very convenient location as the house is within walking distance to LGA so is a great stay for a short pit stop and the unit and shared spaces were very clean. Only criticism is the walls are not very thick so you may hear your neighbors if others are staying there.
2148,773179,2020-11-19,"I highly recommend this place. Due to the privacy/independence of the place (separate floor/entrance) it does indeed qualify as a true ""entire home""; other similarly priced and sized places turn out to be one converted room within some apartment. The area is very safe and authentically Colombian, with many good food options and a number of useful shops in walking distance. The amenities in the place are fine, the heater very special/stylish. The description of the listing is accurate. Towards the end of the stay there was some problem with the internet (maybe external issue) but I am sure they will fix it quickly. I would come again to this place. Ah, I was offered to get my sheets washed but there was no need."
2149,835404,2021-08-15,I wont ever complain about the place it is a big place it an apartment space and its convenient especially the corner store and the subway the hustle especially you can get around the area i will def book again in the future
2150,777929,2020-11-17,"Good location given where we needed to be in Queens. Clean appartment, responsive host, covers all the basics well."
2151,884896,2021-10-30,"This man is an amazing host, he catered to just about every need without having been asked to. The actually apartment was a gold mine for serenity and knowledge, as well as black love and education. A.T has the kind of apartment where a young man like myself would love to meet him from seeing his airbnb set up."
2152,626455,2021-07-10,its on the 5th floor- so pack light but very convenient- heart of Manhattan! Subway is right on the corner and the bus station is right in front of the building.
2153,23084,2020-01-15,"Great place to stay, lots of nice artwork, cosy - great correspondence with hosts who offer plenty of advice about the local area - location good with shops, eating places and subway all within easy walking distance - would stay again - give it a try."
2154,806187,2021-09-06,"The place isn’t very clean. At first, I went barefoot/with socks on, and I got a lot of weird things stuck to my foot. Our room had toenail clippings and other gross stuff on the ground. There were a few spiders I killed and some ants in the bathroom. Also, it says the listing comes with shampoo but the shampoo was basically water with soap in it, as in - the host, when the shampoo ran out, filled it with water to keep it “alive”. On the second night, we got kinda terrified. It sounded like there were gunshots very close to us. We couldn’t sleep for hours and reached out to the host who didn’t respond until very late into the night. Finally, there is another listed room that shares a wall. The other guests were loud and really took advantage of the kitchen situation to the point where we had to wait for them in the morning."
2155,757187,2020-01-02,"Ryad's place was awesome - the location is perfect to all you could want from NY. Easy to get to almost anywhere in Manhattan or jump over to Brooklyn as well. The place was clean and just how it appears in the pictures. Ryad was super attentive, friendly and helpful, which made our stay easy and enjoyable. I would recommend it and would stay there again!"
2156,202354,2019-12-23,Awesome place with affordable price
2157,737315,2019-07-15,"This beautiful apartment has everything you need for a comfortable stay. The architectural accents were beautiful.  Everything (flooring, kitchen, bathroom, furniture) was either new or in excellent shape. Both bed and sofa provided comfortable sleeping."
2158,178986,2019-04-27,I highly recommend Sofia's spot to anyone that is looking to visit NYC. Her apartment is located in a great area of Williamsburg and it is a short train ride from the East Village. Her apartment is super clean and she is a great host! Thank you Sofia!
2159,796052,2019-12-25,"You know when the pictures look amazing and then you get there and it’s even better than the pictures because said pictures just didn’t convey the beautiful FEELING that the home had to give? No? We’ll try Daniel and Helene’s place. <br/><br/><br/>The design is the perfect balance between personal touch but still not all up in your breathing space. Perfect balance of luxurious and cosy. <br/>Every detail is just on point, everywhere in the apartment. <br/>Next time I come back to New York, I’ll definitely check to see if I can stay here again. Thanks guys and hopefully see you soon!"
2160,690065,2019-01-02,One of the nicest people you will ever meet definitely going to stay here again!!!!
2161,427607,2019-05-23,"This is an excellent location for anyone looking to stay near the Columbia medical center. It is about a 7 minute walk from CUMC as well as the medical school. The room is spacious, and Yahaira was very responsive to my messages. I recommend this place!"
2162,168580,2019-08-15,Thanks for kindness and quick response!
2163,848659,2021-05-22,"It was hard to find the room as the numbers are chaotically and incoherently displayed, but once you find it, it's a nice place to stay. Lots of travelers at this hotel too."
2164,753886,2019-09-23,Really convenient apartment with easy connection to Manhattan and Brooklyn.
2165,633859,2019-08-02,"Jeffrey & Casandra's place was really terrific! Jeffrey & Casandra have a beautiful home, that is very clean. Casandra was kind enough to accept a late booking request, and was a wonderful host. I would definitely stay at Jeffrey & Casandra's place again, and highly recommend it to others."
2166,559487,2019-10-05,"A good price-quality room providing the fact how the room situation in NYC is: it has a really good connection to Midtown Manhattan and is located in a relatively ""calm"" area - ideal for a late return from the city using the metro.<br/><br/>The host is really welcoming and nice as well as her dog :)<br/><br/>The room is spaceous and comfy. <br/><br/>So if you are looking for an uncomplicaded place to spend some days for your trip to NYC and don't want to burn your budget in accomodation this a good place to crash."
2167,327652,2021-05-22,Good place. Good value.
2168,521951,2021-08-03,Tonisha welcomed me she is friendly and the place is clean but (its far away from the city 1 hr & half  by subway and the area not safe at all its scary to go outside after 9pm also the neighborhood staring <br/>NOT RECOMMEND AT ALL..<br/>So i didn’t complete my stay <br/>I asked her  through message to do a favor for me  if applicable to refund me half of my payment but she didn’t reply.
2169,597001,2019-09-10,"Khorkhe was a lovely host, and his space is gorgeous and in a wonderful area. Walking around Clinton Hill and enjoying the restaurants was so much fun. The space is clean and well lit. Great air conditioning and amazing water pressure too!"
2170,657819,2019-04-27,Adama was great host!!! <br/>We were comfortable to stay.<br/>Thank you.

2172,711189,2019-10-18,I love the room. Street parking is very convenient.
2173,18085,2019-06-29,"Valerie's place is a real gem.  Having lived abroad for 10 years it is always nice to be back in NYC and in a comfortable genuine apartment that has the nice lived in feeling (i've sadly stayed in places before that felt like ikea showrooms).  The apartment has nice old wood floors and has a nice layout such that the kitchen and bedroom are separated bu a spacious living room.  Everything was spotless clean and Valerie was incredibly quick to respond with any question.  I arrived late at night and the keycafe worked out well for picking up the keys close to midnight.  In addition to the apartment itself, Williamsburg and Greenpoint are great areas and Valerie's place is perfectly located just a few blocks from the busy night life and shopping such that it is both convenient and quiet.  The walk to either the JMZ or LG subway stations is about 5 blocks and takes 5 minutes which makes it easy to get to any part of Manhattan in a blink.  The neighborhood is lively with plenty of restaurants and bars nearby as well as being next to a bodega with a friendly mood and a taco stand out front.  There are a few quality supermarkets and liquor stores within 4-5 blocks so no need to make a special trip to stock up for your stay.  Overall I am thrilled with the stay and it was just what I wanted for my two week work trip."
2174,610869,2019-12-31,"A welcoming Brooklyn apartment. I live in BK and needed a temporary place to stay. Lucky's apartment was a great option. I didn't see Lucky too often, but when I did see him, we had good chats and made sure I was enjoying my stay. Thanks Lucky!"
2175,851819,2021-07-12,Zev's place was extremely comfortable for our family and in an excellent location.

2177,700692,2019-10-27,Great location. No problem parking. Steve was responsive to our questions and helpful with direction to our event. Bed was unbelievably comfortable! Stylish and interesting space. We would stay again.
2178,646010,2019-07-30,Sophia's loft was ideal for my stay in Brooklyn. The neighborhood is wonderful and the home is gorgeous. Sophia and Alex are extremely kind and helpful hosts. I felt like I had a chance to retreat to a very relaxing space after busy days in the city thanks to their inviting/ lovely/ refreshing space. many thanks xoxoxo

2183,654941,2019-10-23,"We had a nice stay at Robertina’s. The house is close to the metro station, less than 10 minutes walk. The bedroom is comfortable, clean, and has its own minifridge. It’s exactly what we were expecting."
2184,100652,2019-11-10,"Spacious studio, great location, and excellent host! Communication with Wilfredo was easy and stress-free. Overall a great experience!"
2185,664344,2021-07-14,"El apartamento es tal y como las fotos, la cama estaba mal armada así que tenía un gran agujero en el medio (que no fue nada cómodo para dormir) y el baño ya casi se despega del piso. Por lo demás esta bastante aceptable, aunque el precio lo sentí elevado para lo que es."
2186,750738,2019-07-21,"I am really glad our family chose this place, it’s a nice, cozy, stylish loft, even spacier than I expected, we felt like at home. Close to Manhattan, on the other hand you can escape it:) lot’s of nice places around. Natalie left us clear instructions, everything was well organised!"

2190,593778,2021-05-23,What a wonderful experience! The room was spacious and clean. Comfortable bed and great pillows. All in all I know that I'll be back :-)
2191,105321,2019-05-20,"On my next trip to NYC, I'll be in touch with Emma once again.  I loved staying at her home.  The location was perfect.  Union Square is 3 blocks away with its subway station.  The Strand Bookstore is 2 blocks away.  Trader Joe's and Whole Foods are across the street from Union Square.  Emma was a great hostess.  She was always available helpful.<br/><br/>Now having said that I was completely happy with Emma's home, I believe others might find the lack of a microwave and a tv to be an issue.  I needed neither so not having them was of no concern to me.  Her living room serves is her studio for painting and is thus minimalist in nature.  Once again, having workspace for my computer that was more than sufficient, so I was completely satisfied.  Someone looking for more ""amenities"" in the living room might be disappointed.  I, however, was not.<br/><br/>In summary, I'll happily return to Emma's on my next trip."
2192,558473,2019-03-22,The room is better than expected
2193,682401,2021-05-09,Enjoyed my stay. Cleanest Airbnb I’ve stayed in.

2195,302635,2020-09-11,Everything was great except Mosquito :(
2196,885177,2021-10-19,Great room!
2197,665451,2019-06-30,Great location close to great food and lots of space and easy access to multiple bus and subway lines! Meir was very responsive I would recommend this place and stay here again!
2198,453781,2019-12-13,"Started off rough upon check in, as there was no key where it was supposed to be and if I did not have small enough hands, we would have never gotten in. By a miracle, the last folks did not lock the place up like they were instructed to, so after I got through the first door, we were able to get into the place. We were standing outside in the rain trying to get in for 15 minutes and calling AJ with no answer. After getting in, the place wasn’t cleaned (dirty linens, dishes, floor, towels) and we didn’t hear from AJ for the first hour or so after check in time. When we did hear from AJ, he was very apologetic as he had his phone stolen and he immediately made the situation better by coming to clean while we went to dinner. Then he was even kind enough to go buy us some wine and other treats to make up for it. And AJ comped the first night, which was nice but necessary after the hassle. So all in all, it worked out but was a rough start. As far as the place goes, it was in a great location close to the subway and food near by. One downside was the oven doesn’t work except for one burner, but wasn’t the biggest deal. We appreciate the way AJ handled the situation and understand that life happens, just wish we would have communicated his situation."
2199,737949,2021-11-11,"Great clean room and great, quick response time."
2200,532912,2019-10-05,"Dora's place was exactly what me and my wife needed for our stay in NYC. There are two metro stops in a 5 minute radius,  with trains that take you right to Manhattan in approx. 15 min. The neighborhood is also suprisingly quiet at night so we could get a good night sleep after a full day of exploration. Dora was also very responsive and kind by letting us store our luggage on our last day as our flight back home was late in the evening. All in all we had a nice stay and would gladly stay here again if we were back in NYC."
2201,777300,2021-10-13,To make a story short: we love that place. We came there 4 times already!!....<br/>Parking is possible although a challenge. The area is super quite. The place is very pleasant. We feel home.
2202,751048,2020-11-25,Great Place To Stay

2207,582199,2021-05-15,"Great place to stay and so close to any line on the subway system. Great jumping off point to get to Manhattan, Brooklyn, or Astoria. Quiet neighborhood with a market a few hundred feet away for snacks or emergency items. Price was very reasonable. Would definitely stay again."

2210,692574,2021-02-04,"Victoria’s Place was Place was so nice The lighting inside was Amazing ! My fav thing to do there was wake up and have my morning tea by the beautiful giant window she has in her kitchen!! She was very quick to respond no matter what time it was. Very helpful even recommended a great Spanish restaurant with great food I ordered from there at least 5 out of the 10 days I stood there. Victoria is doll!! She accommodated me and my family in every kind of way! Book with her, you’ll be happy you did. The place was clean, great natural light wood floor beautiful island in the kitchen spacious, I would suggest you ask how to use the heat/ac unit before  you attempt to use it so you can understand it. Key code on door so there’s no person to person interaction especially during the pandemic. No kind of problem at all. Great stay! Highly recommend!"
2211,685439,2021-09-30,"This was a great, comfortable stay. My husband was in NY for 6 months and needed a place to call home for the time being. Myself and our son came to visit one weekend and it was perfect. Great set up for the cost. Roomy space he made his own for the time being. The area Forest Hills is so great, walkable to cafe’s and restaurants. Very peaceful part of town. Thank you Nadia for always being available and quick to respond to any needs my husband had. We wish you the best in all your ventures :)"

2214,715130,2020-02-17,Had an amazing stay during valentine. Everything was taken care of and when something was not in order Shelley was right at it to help and fix it. When it comes to sleeping and the house itself; my girlfriend called the bed  “the best bed ever”!
2215,673712,2019-05-22,The host canceled this reservation 9 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2216,800725,2021-11-02,"John's place is superb - and his communication with us was excellent. The apartment has everything you need and more <br/>( i.e. a super comfortable reclining couch ). It is very quiet as it faces the back, and it is therefore easy to sleep. Neighborhood is great. Top-notch all around"
2217,778124,2019-12-01,"My mom stayed at Sarah's place over Thanksgiving and really enjoyed her stay. The space that Sarah has created for her guests is really wonderful. Very clean, there is a kitchen area with a fridge, sink, coffee maker, dishes, etc. The apt is very well located (close to trains, a grocery store, lots of shops) and better than probably 99% of the hotels in Brooklyn. My mom said she would stay again--so, high praise!"
2218,646791,2019-04-21,"Safe neighbourhood, transport walking distance, clean place, comfortable bed.<br/>However the last night the host held a party with many drop by until 6am making it near impossible to catch some shut eye."

2221,833880,2021-02-07,"Stylish place! Photos are very accurate & the place was clean. Everything you need is there! <br/>I only wish the balcony was shoveled or snow pushed to the side. Although it had snowed a couple days before, It was a very nice sunny day during our stay & we couldn't enjoy the balcony because it wasn't shoveled. The balcony was a deciding factor in choosing this place so that was a bit of a bummer. Other than that we enjoyed our staycation & there are many places to eat nearby!  I would certainly book this place again!"
2222,890302,2021-11-13,My bf and I really enjoyed our stay here. Checking in and out was super easy. Sarah was super responsive and even accommodated our checkin/out times. She also left us a personalized note and snacks! The place itself was super cozy and the perfect size for us. The location was also the best part! Super close to the metro and a wide variety of food spots. 10/10 I would come back and stay here again.

Lovely interior architecture, floor to ceiling bay windows, flooded with sunlight, high ceilings, shiny floor.<br/>The space is quite Spartan, lacking a lived-in feel, which others might not like, but I absolutely love. It makes the space feel larger and uncluttered. Area feels very authentic and “Brooklyn” close to everything. And great value. <br/><br/>Highly recommend"
2225,816914,2020-12-26,Typical basement apartment in queens. A little noisey but sufficient for crew who need a quick place

2239,64986,2019-08-29,"This place is perfect if you want to stay near the subway. literally a 2 min walk away. We used all the amenities such as washer and dryer, hairdryer,  iron and forth so they were very handy to have. Just noticed it needed a little bit more attention in some spots when it comes to cleaning but wasn't unbearable. Kakuna is very helpful, we met her in person and she is lovely to chat with. Overall was a good experience."

2262,850197,2021-03-02,"AMAZING PLACE!<br/><br/>I was a long-term guest for the month of February and absolutely LOVED this place. Felt like the ideal studio apartment, I only wish I could live there full-time!<br/><br/>Biggest draw for me was definitely the sizable, fully-stocked kitchen and fridge as someone who likes to cook a lot, but the bed was comfortable, the bathroom was clean, and the space was stylish! <br/><br/>That's not mentioning the location!!! Super conveniently located to the bustling 125th, this is an ideal spot for access to grocery stores and the subway.<br/><br/>Kiney is also super nice, thoughtful, and has an amazing response rate!<br/><br/>Would particularly recommend this for long-term stays but anyone will feel lucky to stay here!"
2263,395625,2019-12-08,Great place in a great location. Comfy bed. You won't regret choosing this Airbnb

2271,159167,2021-04-30,"Amazing location and Carlo was a great host. Very quick to respond and we appreciated him allowing us to stay for 3 months on such short notice, and with an emotional support animal. The apartment was not especially well cleaned (dusty) when we got there, so we had to do a little bit of cleaning of our own. He did have a woman come to clean right after our stay, so it should be better for his next guest!! The apartment is historical and charming on its own, but be careful if you have any chronic pain/difficulty walking/respiratory conditions because the top floor walk up doesn’t get any easier over time! Great exercise though lol. Thank you, Carlo!!"
2272,209067,2019-06-09,"If you come across Matthew's and Marilyn's listing, do not hesitate. Book it. Their space is superb:<br/>1. Location is the best and most strategic place to stay in NY city. Accessible and close to subway, tourist spots and any other public transport<br/>2. Space is clean, spick and span. You get your own room with all amenities and toiletries provided<br/>3.

2273,465284,2019-04-13,"Giselle’s place is perfect for solo travellers. The location is amazing, just a short walk from Central Park and great food just a few blocks away. She was a wonderful host, and made me feel welcome and safe."
2274,881108,2021-09-05,"My group of friends and I had a great stay here. It was clean and a very cozy studio apartment. The building itself definitely needs renovating, especially since we had to go up and down broken stairs that had a “Use at your own risk” sign. Yikes! But that is out of Marlin’s control, so it was very nice to see he keeps his apartment in good condition."
2275,438467,2019-05-07,"Good location, very closed to subway. Room was clean. Both Mark and William are very helpful and quick response."
2276,834409,2021-05-15,"This was the worst experience I’ve had using Airbnb. For the sake of our community’s safety, here are some highlights from my five-month stay with Edwin:<br/><br/>ADDRESS: The address was inaccurate. I asked the host several times to revise it, but he refused to do so. Please be sure to verify the address and request that the host change it. The host should also call Airbnb to correct the error immediately. Otherwise, it means that the listing identifies a different address that was subsequently changed to this small flat’s address without Airbnb's permission. <br/><br/>ROOM: The room was in a very small flat situated in a noisy building with weekday and weekend parties. The bed was squeaky and uncomfortable, and the room faced an elementary school. If you are only in New York City for a short time and want the ability to sleep in on weekdays, I don’t recommend this place since it is impossible to sleep once the students are on the playground. Similarly, you can hear sounds from the school building day and night. If you want to enjoy your stay in this room and are bothered by a lot of noise, you should wear a noise-canceling headset most of the time. In addition, when the door to my room was completely closed, there was still an open space through which the host and other guests could peer through from the outside. To ensure full privacy, the host should correct this issue immediately before booking any new guests.<br/><br/>CLEANING: The host never cleaned the flat. Instead, his guests carried out this task. He failed to follow Airbnb’s 5-step cleaning process during my stay, though it is advertised in his description.<br/><br/>COVID-19: The host was well aware of other guests who were infected with COVID-19. However, he did not inform me immediately. Instead, he referred to the incident five days later, after ensuring that he had received a negative result. This was unacceptable and demonstrated the host's disregard for his guests’ safety. If you rent this room, make sure the place is cleaned per Airbnb's 5-step cleaning process to preserve your health. While there, I asked about the delayed cleaning service, and the host became angry with me. He then offered me a refund and asked me to leave the flat. He did not respect me as a guest, was not concerned about my health, and did not look for a solution to remedy the situation. He also refused to clean the flat when other guests were impacted by COVID-19. Instead, he stated that the infected guests would clean the area themselves and that the virus would not be transferred from the surfaces of the communal areas. How so?<br/><br/>HONESTY: After the COVID-19 incident, the host got upset with me when I requested to stay another month, according to a verbal agreement we made in April, and stated that his family would be using the flat from mid-June onward. However, this small room is still available on Airbnb for anyone to reserve, and it is now listed at a higher rental price. The excuse about his family was clearly a false reason crafted to end my stay and raise the rent on his small, noisy room. The host did not abide by his word or respect our agreement. Should you need anything from this host, please document your conversations and inquiries with him in writing on Airbnb. Otherwise, he will report you to Airbnb for false actions and activities. Be careful!<br/><br/>PRIVACY: The host also tended to invade my privacy. He frequently asked questions about personal things that he was not entitled to ask about. I tried to ignore him several times, but he was like this until the last conversation we had in the flat. In addition, he complained a great deal about the rent. He asked me to pay him directly, and I told him to use Airbnb. Communicating with the host clearly and respectfully was quite difficult.  <br/><br/>COMMON AREAS: In the flat, there was also a respectful female guest I often spoke to and shared coffee within the common area. However, the host interrupted us several times and asked us to leave the common area because he was working. He also shouted at us many times and never had the opportunity to attend to his guests. The four guests were all dissatisfied with his behavior, though most of them paid directly rather than through Airbnb. This is why his other guests present during my stay could not leave reviews on Airbnb, though they did leave his flat for good. One good takeaway on this trip was that his former guests became good friends of mine.<br/><br/>LIGHTS: For the most part, the host turned off the lights in the communal area. When they were lit, they were switched off almost immediately. This was a highly unusual experience. The host knew that I had recently had eye surgery, so the lights were vital to me when I used the common areas, especially at the end of the night. <br/><br/>CONCLUSION: Though I experienced much more during the past five months, I have noted the most remarkable incidents that occurred during my stay. I wouldn't recommend this host to anyone, so please find another clean, quiet, peaceful, and safe place to enjoy your trip to New York without any hassle. <br/><br/>Many thanks for reading this, and please stay safe!"

2279,524648,2019-09-29,Perfect location and a very quiet apartment. I was pleasantly surprised that the apartment was very quiet especially given how loud NYC can be.

2281,882131,2021-12-04,"This place was small and incredibly basic; there wasn’t proper bedding, barely any plates and cutlery, and the only areas outside of your room are the bathroom or kitchen. The hosts never contacted me to make sure I checked in ok or if I needed anything. There was no lockbox so I was reliant on someone else being home to open the door. Poor service in my opinion. I would not recommend a stay longer than a few days."
2282,601792,2019-11-16,Super responsive and a wide time range to check-in.
2283,618243,2019-02-23,"Hands down the best place to stay in the northern section of The Bronx.  Karen is a thoughtful, gracious host and the apartment is comfortable, clean and well equipped with modern amenities. It's located on a quaint residential street yet is close and convenient to everything in the area. Normally would never consider renting a car in NYC, but here it's very doable and actually recommended for travelers whose places of interest are located solely in The Bronx and/or Westchester County."
2284,640375,2020-02-18,Yva’s place was awesome as usual. I’ve stayed at her place many times and it’s the only Airbnb I feel comfortable staying at. She provided everything I needed and everything was clean and cozy. Thanks again Yva!
2285,622527,2019-06-23,Marie's place is beautiful and spacious! She is a very nice lady and was really helpful and available during our stay. She had many amenities for us that we really enjoyed.

2286,597193,2020-02-06,"A very cozy, warm and pleasant house, like being in my own house. The Host, Chester, helps a lot with directions, guides, active wi fi, all the time.<br/>Hot water always and in abundance, all perfect, the truth that, my Family and I, we highly recommend it."

2288,439984,2019-04-16,"Muy contentas con la experiencia, las indicaciones para llegar súper fáciles, el lugar acogedor, limpio, casi no convivimos con Herbert y su hermano pero la verdad fue parte de la privacidad que nos dieron y eso nos encantó, la estación del metro súper cerca a unas 4 cuadras más o menos y la línea que llega ahí es la mejor lleva dirección a todos lados súper fácil y rápido. Hay a lado de la estación un lugar súper recomendable para desayunar, y cerca de la escuela un lugar de pizzas delicioso y económico. <br/>Un lugar recomendado"

2295,660186,2019-05-24,The place was very homely and good for one night!  Eufemia was very welcoming and I loved interacting with her. The bathroom felt a bit cramped (especially if you are used to a bigger one at home!) other than that my stay was very comfortable!

The apartment is modern and clean, located close to trendy areas (Myrtle Av. & Williamsburg). Our room is big and comfortable. We really enjoyed our stay. Thank you very much for making our trip memorable!"
2300,548328,2019-05-26,"great location, clean apartment, great host."
2301,687251,2019-03-17,"Walkiria's place was very much as described.  She had excellent communication - always quick to respond.  Her mom greeted us and let us in within just a few minutes of our arrival.  She also blessed us with breakfast each morning with her homemade traditional foods of her birth country.  Loved it!!  And we very much appreciated that extra touch, especially on the day we were checking out heading to the airport.  Our brunch was just right for holding us over till we got through security at the airport.  We really felt at home and enjoyed getting to know the family through our conversations and educational surroundings.  Plenty of books to catch your interest if you are not completely scheduled.  The building outside was well lit and the area seemed safe.  It is also is convenient to the subway and shopping necessities.  A CVS and Dwayne Reed (Walgreens) are within walking distance along with a park and weekly Farmer's Market and other sidewalks sales and shops.  Thanks, Walkiria and Momma!"
2302,623930,2019-09-28,"I had been in the apt. for three weeks and my overall impression is okay to good. On the pro side: the neighborhood is quiet, grocery stores, laundry services and restaurants are nearby and so is the subway station. The apt. itself has a nice and comfy living room, an usable but a bit underequiped kitchen, shared bathroom and three sleeping rooms (one of them with a enclosed bathroom). The apt. is reasonable clean. On the con side: exept from the living room, you can not open the windows (all rooms are equiped with ACs) what I disliked a lot, the kitchen could use some more and better equipment such as knifes, an espresso machine, etc. Finally it was a bit unclear who is responsible for cleaning the rooms/apt. in general and maybe some kind of guest info (i.e. does and who lives in the othe rooms)- so a tad more of communocation would be good as well. Finally and possible most important: the apt. was quite cheap, compared to other offers, I always felt save and I basically enjoyed the stay."
2303,564969,2019-05-20,Beautiful home! Great hosts! I would stay here on every visit to NYC

2306,585739,2021-11-18,"Great place, great location. It's really an excelent place for one or two. The only thing for me is it did not have a coffee machine (or if it had I couldn't find it). What you see is what you get, so I really appreciated that. Host let me check in a couple of hours in advance. Another plus!"

2308,796115,2021-09-17,"Great location, and really nicely designed and appointed. Great a/c and outdoor space. Laundry in unit is a huge plus. As is the case in most apartments, noise travels easily from the unit above."
2309,175445,2019-12-12,"Great location in a very nice part of Brooklyn with lots of restaurants, shops and the subway to Manhattan within easy walking distance. <br/>The apartment is spacious and very comfortable with a well stocked kitchen that has everything you need. Susan had left bagels and milk plus lots of other extras to welcome us when we arrived and it really made such a difference on our arrival not to have to shop for essentials straight away. <br/>Everything in the apartment has been thoughtfully selected for an enjoyable, stress free and relaxing stay. The manual book was a great addition if there was anything you needed to know. <br/>Susan is a super host, very warm and welcoming and you will not be disappointed if you book with her. We hope to stay with her again when we next visit New York."

2322,634579,2019-07-11,"We stayed at Cesar's place in the Bronx area of NYC. First impression: the apartment was spotless. Felt, looked and smelled clean. My wife commented and was pleased about it, and she is an extremely clean person. A very nice touch was the washer and dryer on the premises. Extremely quiet place, and I was absolutely thrilled about how easy it was a nearby parking spot everytime. Remember people out there, this is NYC, not known for being parking friendly, but this particular area was. Cesar responded to all my questions very quickly, sent us links to nearby attractions and was very nice to deal with him. I must say that the area was very close to all major highways, the Bronx Zoo, and even a place called City Island? where we even enjoyed a bay front area with nice eating joints. I definitely recommend Cesar's place while in the area and will must certainly contact him next time we happen to be in NYC."
2323,757275,2019-09-20,"Everything about Adam's place exceeded our expectations. The original listing seemed to promise everything we were looking for in a gorgeous Brooklyn pad to use as a bee for our visit — and we arrived to be ever MORE impressed. A gorgeous, well maintained, sparkling clean apartment. Super straight forward process for access, easy and well thought through communication, and all the right considerations to make you feel at home. Thank you Adam for exceeding every single expectation we had."

2330,745536,2019-11-17,We really enjoyed our stay at Robert's place. The location was great & he was very accommodating. We landed from a red eye and he allowed us to get in early to sleep for a few hours. He was super quick in responding and was very helpful.

2333,768998,2019-11-23,"Elvis is a great host. He was readily available when needed and was always willing to help. He took great care of his guests and whenever he saw me asked if I needed anything. He was genuinely interested in making his guests feel comfortable and at home.  My room was very cozy, comfortable and had everything I needed including a nice tv a great sofa and a desk. The floor where I stayed included a common area, kitchen and bathroom. The whole floor was very clean. I never had a problem sharing the bathroom or kitchen - seemed almost like private although there was another student staying on the same floor. Elvis's house was very close to stores and restaurants if one needed to walk to get something. I had my car and I was able to easily find parking space on the same block of Elvis's house every time.  In the backyard there was a nice sitting area where one could eat - unfortunately I was there during colder days and didn't use it, but it looked very pleasant. I was rotating at SIUH  and it was no problem driving. I enjoyed meeting Elvis and staying in his home very much."
2334,859528,2021-07-01,"Genuinely the loveliest and most helpful Airbnb hosts I’ve ever met. My brother and I stayed for almost three weeks, and Michelle and her partner were incredibly helpful and friendly. They installed an air conditioner a few days after we arrived (without us asking or anything, we knew the space didn’t have one), offered us their spare litterbox since we were staying with my cat, and dropped off extra shampoo etc. I knew that if we needed anything we could just ask. The place is also very walkable to subway lines, grocery stores, bars etc. We had a great experience!"
2335,849886,2021-02-13,Great stay! We enjoyed this beautiful and convenient hotel room.
2336,840956,2021-05-02,Sherry's place was very nice and cozy in a cute neighborhood in upper eastside. We enjoyed our stay and Sherry was quick to respond. We would definitely come back.
2337,831564,2021-05-15,"I enjoyed my stay here. It’s a great location if you’re looking to explore Brooklyn. It’s a block from the train and very close to a myriad of places to eat. <br/><br/>Check-in is very easy and the host communicates in a timely fashion. <br/><br/>Because this is her home, it almost makes you not want to touch anything but you’ll get over that. She is very welcoming and encourages you to make yourself at home<br/><br/>My only compaint is that I booked the space for the beautiful shared backyard but the space is not clean at all or setup to host anything or anyone back there. (granted this may be the fault of the neighbor and not the host). Tone specific, the cushions are dirty, the fire pit is full of cigarette buds, etc."
2338,513944,2019-06-14,"Gulcin was a great host and we really enjoyed staying in her room! She was so kind and helpful. Everything was great for our stay, the place is sparkling clean, the location was perfect and the place is a great value!"

2347,268582,2020-03-02,"Our overall stay was ok, however we were expecting a lot more based on photos, descriptions, previous reviews and rent level. We had issues throughout our stay with hot water (which the host did assist us with, but it was very inconvenient having this issue reoccurring weekly for 2 months), lighting in the apartment is dark, many appliances are faulty. However, the apartment was spacious and we liked the washer, dryer and dishwasher. The balcony was a plus too! Just a heads up, you’ll be asked to replace all basic cleaning supplies etc at the end of your stay which we never experienced at any Airbnb before, especially considering rent and cleaning fees."
2348,713020,2021-06-24,"Great spot to crash on the city. It is exactly as pictured. Quiet, clean, pretty, and Laureta and James were very helpful and prompt when I reached out. I would stay again for a short stay."

2350,740203,2019-06-22,"Jenny&Jose's place is very cosy and, in addition, it gives you independence and privacy - what is rather (Email hidden by Airbnb) munication with the hosts was fantastic and everything was as expected. It is a very interesting part of the city. The apartment is in-between gentrified and non-gentrified part of Brooklyn. If you want to see a city in transition, you will have an opportunity."
2351,495294,2021-04-20,Reuben is very welcoming and hospitable. Everything went great!
2352,779952,2019-10-20,"Amy is a good host. Very helpful. Her place is nice, appropriate for young travelers and people who needs a place to stay for a short term. The place has only one bathroom so make sure to put your name on a list if you needed to use the bathroom for longer. Getting to the city was very easy, there's restaurants and stores around the area. Around the house there's free parking available. The only thing I can say that isn't great is that the bed on the room we stayed in was an inflatable mattress, I don't know if all of them are the same but it's better to ask, for that price you better have a real bed on the room."
2353,889191,2021-11-18,good place! great location.

Nick made the access to the property very simple but very Safe. <br/><br/>Oh and you have the subway a couple blocks away (piece of cake to get anywhere through the public service) and UBER never stops….. <br/><br/>Just rent it and don’t waste money on expensive hotels bad get to know the real NY

2362,525513,2020-03-23,"I'm the former Travel editor for the Denver Post, and so I've stayed in hundreds of Airbnbs since the company's inception. This is without a doubt my favorite of all time! For starters, Jaime's attention to detail made what was already an excellent location (be sure to try the Peruvian Surfish on the corner, as it's excellent, and there are many, many organic markets, shops, pharmacies, etc. well within a few blocks' walk) and a sweet, charmingly decorated space even more appealing: Things like bags for shopping, nice paper napkins, food storage containers, books on New York things to do, tons of lovely lotions and everyday toiletries, extra kleenex, paper towels and TP, plenty of pots and pans and other things for cooking, multiple umbrellas, you name it -- if we needed it, it was almost always there. The couple of things I recommended (a bottle to keep water cold in the fridge, more ice cube trays) appeared on the door step the next day. Jaime is incredibly responsive (always got a message from her within minutes), and cares deeply that her tenants have an excellent experience. She connected me with an outstanding mobile laundry service, and knew where I could find pretty much anything in the neighborhood. The subway is just a few blocks away. She also supplied some basic ingredients, including herbs and spices, oatmeal, butter, snacks and an amazing locally made raspberry jam. I felt totally safe, and the neighborhood is pretty friendly in general. I stayed for two weeks -- I wish I could have stayed longer, and I'll for sure be back."
2363,761459,2020-01-01,"great, stylish, convenient, and safe place to stay in nyc if you’re visiting for a couple of days. it has all you need in terms of acceptable amenities in a building. The front desk staff was friendly, welcoming, and helpful to talk to and ask about general/specific information.<br/><br/>Shahzeb was highly communicative and responsive over the airbnb app as well as over text messaging. He made sure my family had no issues checking in and checking out. and whenever my family had questions for him, he answered right away and thoroughly.<br/><br/>My family would definitely consider staying in his apartment in nyc again next time they plan to visit nyc."

2365,433096,2020-12-26,We had a great time and enjoyed our stay. The apartment is five blocks from the subway and will soon be closer when the new line is operational.

2366,719742,2019-04-07,"Leo is a great host. His place is clean and in a very nice neighborhood  that is conveniently located within walking distance of several restaurants and deli's, many that are open 24 hours. It is about one mile to the closest subway station and Uber's and Lyft's arrive promptly to the area. I would definitely stay with Leo again."

Look no further for a place to stay in Brooklyn, NY as this space is impeccable and fully furnished. We arrived just as the cleaning lady finished cleaning and the apartment was super clean. The hospitality shown by Myles during our weeklong stay was second to none and there is no wonder why there are so many glowing reviews. This is a private, roomy place to call home in a safe neighbourhood and close (5 min walk) to the subway. Kitchen and bathroom are gorgeous, modern, and spotless.  Free Wi Fi and 400 tv channels.

2394,890103,2021-11-11,Beautifully furnished apartment. Check in process involved us meeting someone to let us into the apartment. It could have been cleaned more thoroughly. Not enough towels. It was a comfortable stay if you’re not very picky. Great value for 3 nights in Manhattan.
2395,751136,2019-11-29,"I stayed at Wilson's apartment for a month in November. I really had a good time! The apartment is nice and cozy and has everything you need for living (including really fast WiFi!). The area is great - close to central park and with lots of restaurents and bars nearby, and just a few minutes walk from the 6 train Subway station. Wilson is an amazing host! He really makes sure that you have everything you need and although I did not encounter any problems during my stay I am 100% sure that he would assist if anything is needed. I would definitely stay there again!"
2396,871965,2021-10-26,"Location, location, location-this place cannot be beat for that!  We walked to see everything.  The room itself is so cozy and nice as is the boutique style place; the sitting areas inside and out would have been a great place to lounge had we not been sightseeing so much.  The little kitchen in the lobby was stocked for our morning tea and coffee.  Although we didn’t use it, room service is available with no extra fees for delivery.  The area is very safe.  I would caution you about the stairs.  If you are unable to cart your luggage up several flights, look elsewhere.  Luckily, we had very small overnight bags.  Other than that, it was perfection!!!<br/>P.S.- When coming to NYC, wear very comfortable clothes and shoes.  No one dresses up, even for Broadway plays."
2397,313421,2019-05-31,Leecia nimmt einen sehr freundlich in Empfang. Die Unterkunft ist sehr nett und so wie auf den Fotos abgebildet.<br/>Wir fanden die Umgebung nicht so wie beschrieben und haben uns dort leider nicht wohl gefühlt.

2399,693745,2019-05-31,"Está muy bien ubicado, cerca a  Time square y a Hudson yards (cerca al vessel). Es muy fácil llegar desde el aeropuerto Newark, el tren te deja en Penn station y de allí puedes caminar al hotel. No tienen desayuno pero si te ofrecen un café y pan (deliciosos). Hay una máquina de snakcs que es perfecta para comprar agua embotellada y soda. La habitación que nos tocó era amplia, con tina, agua caliente y fría. Con aire acondicionado y televisión por cable. Todos los empleados son muy amables. Pregunta por los impuestos antes de reservar."
2400,700237,2021-11-29,"A great host! Super attentive and kind. The house is new, the location is great and the room very clean. <br/>I would totally come back!"
2401,875220,2021-11-15,"A very clean, spacious, and comfortable stay! Jenny is quick to respond and extremely considerate when it comes to her guests! Plus, it’s a great location.

He’s very friendly and clear with the instructions and his place is dreamy! Very close to the train station that takes you to Manhattan, Queens and even The Bronx (you can get there with only 2 train transfers), You can get to mostly any point of NY from the train station nearby.<br/>The neighborhood is very safe and with markets nearby. You get several food places to choose on the area.<br/>Stop looking for a place now and book this one, you will be more that pleased to stay here!"
2404,749167,2020-02-29,"Ms. Kathryn is by far the greatest host we have ever had. Simply an amazing, professional and caring individual.

2411,565042,2020-07-27,It was a tranquil stay in  an extremely tidy and lovely place. The bed was super comfortable and the other guests were always courteous. The host was able to do some computer scans for me which helped me tremendously. I would definitely return for another visit.
2412,688626,2021-10-01,I highly recommend this location.<br/>it was beautifully appointed immaculate and the hosts are superb.<br/>The  little outside area is lovely the house is set up to accommodate any family or couples and the location is perfect.<br/>just a quick block to the subway ...all in all I recommend this location and plan on returning someday in the future.
2413,509435,2019-12-25,"The apartment is in a great part of Brooklyn, close to the park and close to the subway. The apartment itself is warm and clean, with a good bed and enough towels and kitchenware for a comfortable stay.  As advised, one can hear the patter of little feet in the morning."
2414,467016,2020-01-17,"It is a wonderful place, particularly nice location for if your food destinations are in Chinatown (hot pot, dim sum, Tiger Sugar!) There are many metro lines nearby as well. The room is lovely and clean. 2 bathrooms are a real plus for an air bnb. Thank you!"
2415,681629,2019-03-22,My daughter and a friend visited NYC for Spring! They Raved about Mustak and Farzana’s place...they loved the thoughtful touches!!! Highly recommend!
2416,678426,2019-03-30,This was my first stay at an airbnb and this place was nice! It was very clean which I loved! looks just like the pics. The second bed in the loft area is on the floor as just a heads up to other travelers but this wasn't a huge issue for me. Nice stay!
2417,74798,2019-08-11,"We stayed in Nick's place when our own apartment was being renovated. It is clean, light-filled, and lovingly decorated. Neala the kitty cat is a delight. Thank you, Nick and Neala!"

2420,852196,2021-07-08,"Excelente ubicación, cerca de todo el transporte público perfecto para moverse por la ciudad. También cuenta con tiendas de autoservicio cerca para comprar comida. Lo recomiendo para unas cortas vacaciones."
2421,867203,2021-10-01,"Jakob's place was simple in its presentation; however, and more importantly, it was clean, spacious, and a great value. The room is on the second floor of a private home, but secluded from most of the other living spaces, it affords a great deal of privacy. The house is on a quiet street (makes for a good sleep void of the street noises so common in other parts of NYC) not too far from three different stops on the E and F subway lines, and it's also a 15 or so minute walk to the station where one can pick up the AirTran that leads to JFK International. Jakob was very communicative and reached out to me in order to work out the logistics around my arrival. He shared all the necessary information upon check-in and was gone quickly, allowing me to settle in for a great night's rest. Definitely planning to book here again if my travels take me through JFK and I require an overnight stay."
2422,363592,2019-11-05,Nice clean bedrooms. Roomy dining room and kitchen. They have a deck that is beautiful in good weather.
2423,766397,2019-09-20,Fantastic location and a real taste of the Brooklyn lifestyle. Genevieve and Devin were unbelievable hosts who assisted at every opportunity. Great stay.
2424,644141,2021-11-07,Perfect place to stay in a beautiful Harlem brownstone - on a lovely and quiet street that’s still steps from Harlem’s best restaurants and right off the 2/3 so you can quickly get anywhere else in the city.  We lived in the neighborhood for 10 years and come back frequently - this is definitely one of the nicest places we have stayed.  Hosts were great.
2425,623938,2021-07-12,Rita and Ernesto are very nice and helpful but I have to remark that i found  the place with a dirty and old mattress that make noise just sitting on it... for sure need to be replace. Location is safe an convenient. just as describe.  Not a problem finding parking.  not a five stars to me but ok to stay if you need it.
2426,646285,2020-11-09,"Travis was a amazing host. Very polite and professional. He addressed the one concern with my stay immediately the next day, and resolved the issue.

2434,311090,2020-01-01,"We had a very pleasant stay in Carlos' home.<br/>Our room was very large, super clean and lovely furnished, we felt very comfortable and found everything we needed. The shared bathroom and kitchen were perfectly clean.<br/>Carlos is a very friendly host and does everything to make his guests feel comfortable in his home. He gave us a very warm welcome and was available to answer all of our questions at any time. He had many tips for staying in NYC and also to find our way around the neighborhood regarding restaurants, supermarkets, train connections etc., which was very helpful.<br/>If we come back to NYC we would love to come back to Carlos’ house. We can recommend this place to everyone!"
2435,751896,2019-12-27,Cozy clean appartment with plenty to do around as well as easy access to subway. Niki was very nice and responsive throughout the process. Stay here.

2439,658665,2019-05-27,Nice place for an overnight stay - very close to transportation and to restaurants!

2444,842451,2021-05-19,Amazing
2445,804798,2020-02-15,Had a wonderful stay at Vickie’s place.
2446,678146,2021-07-28,"Lovely place with lots of natural light and a charming aesthetic. Excellent kitchen. Clean bathroom and the shower had lots of water pressure & hot water. Comfy couch. 2 ACs so we could separately cool the bedroom and front area. Molly also invited us to use the herbs she grows in her garden when we cooked :)<br/><br/>My only complaints are that there was no desk and the wifi flickered sometimes, even when you had good connection. It worked perfectly for Netflix, but if you're going to be working remote and need video chat or RDP, except some interruptions and bring a data hot-spot.<br/><br/>Overall a fantastic place, as well as cheap and close to both the LIRR train line and the Orange Line. An easy 5 stars."
2447,140076,2019-10-21,Wonderful location. Easy access to yellow line and m60 bus. Surprisingly quiet.
2448,176986,2019-03-10,Great spot for those that want quick access to fun Brooklyn neighborhoods.
2449,30808,2019-10-24,"We really enjoyed our stay at Katherine‘s apartment. The flat was very clean and equipped with everything you need to feel comfortable. <br/>Check-in and check-out worked perfectly. There is a doorman at the entrance of the building, so it is no problem to get the keys if you are arriving late or early. There is also the possibility to leave the luggage at the doorman‘s place after the check-out.<br/>Close to the apartment there is a huge supermarket. There you find everything, the prices are ok and it’s open every day.<br/>To go to Midtown or Downtown the best option is to take the subway. We always took the number 6 from 28th street. It’s a 10 minute walk from the apartment. But there are also some bus stops, they are closer than the subway.<br/>The apartment is on the 6th floor and in line with the street. So if you have an easy sleep it’s better to take earplugs. During weekdays it’s very loud in the morning  - especially a lot of hooting cars. But after some days we got used to it.<br/>Katherine is a very thoughtful and well organised host. She stayed in touch with us and was very fast in answering our questions. <br/><br/>Thank you Katherine!"
2450,802193,2021-10-15,Comfortable place in a quiet neighborhood. Great location for accessing Manhattan or enjoying Astoria.
2451,320614,2019-06-30,"Lorraine’s place is so cool and trendy! The room was just what I needed and the AC worked perfectly. It was in a nice area of Brooklyn, but just a little far from the subway stops. Great stay overall and the kitties were a bonus!"
2452,602002,2019-09-16,"It's a cheap stay for New York, the Subway and a good deli right in front. 10 minutes with the subway to Manhattan and 20 minutes to walk to Dumbo. 4th floor without elevator, so be sure you have no heavy luggage, and the bathroom is tiny. But there are 2 super sweet cats in the apartment, who loves to snuggle"
2453,818515,2020-08-11,Great place to stay. I’ve stayed here multiple times always worth it.
2454,756539,2020-11-21,"Fantastic stay! Easy check in and out. Responsive host, helped us check in early after our long flight. Highly recommend!"
2455,761921,2020-04-30,An absolutely amazing stay. Couldn’t have chosen a better space or better host. Jessica and Ed were so hospitable and quick to respond. The house was clean and neat and in a fantastic location. I would absolutely stay here again!
2456,588978,2019-06-08,"Fue mi primer AIRBNB y estuvo muy bien. El lugar era tal como lo describió el dueño, es muy tranquilo, ideal para descansar y relajar.  La ubicación está buan. Joey y su rommate están en sus cosas pero muy dispuestos a ayudar si lo necesitas. Mucho mejor que en un hostel, y a mitad de precio."
2457,734615,2020-09-26,"Beautiful home. Comfortable beds, comfy sofa. Very homey feeling. Quiet neighborhood. Host right next store. Very helpful, friendly and sweet. Will definitely book again!!"
2458,633476,2019-05-23,All ok
2459,446570,2019-08-26,Claudette’s is an excellent host who goes out her way to ensure that her guests are comfortable. During our stay she frequently checked with us to see if there was anything extra that we needed. Her place is very clean and it has its own private space which is great because you don’t have to trot  through the house returning from late nights out in the Big Apple.<br/><br/> Although it’s a basement room it has windows that offer lots of natural light and it’s very spacious. The neighborhood is very quiet and it’s close to shopping and public transportation. We would definitely stay with Claudette again on future visits to NYC.
2460,756611,2019-10-10,"Sebastian è un proprietario veramente eccezionale. Molto disponibile e attento verso i suoi ospiti. La sua è una bella casa, ottima location,  pulitissima e comoda. Sicuramente da raccomandare come superhost."
2461,354205,2019-06-25,"John was a great host who responded promptly to my messages. The unit was very clean and easy to access. The location in east village is near many shops, bars, and transit, so getting around was easy."
2462,666720,2019-09-17,"Andrew ist ein großartiger Gastgeber! Er ist nicht nur super, sondern die Wohnung auch. Sie liegt sehr zentral im Brooklyn und nur 3min von einer Metrostation entfernt, welche direkt nach Manhattan fährt. Alles in allem ein toller Aufenthalt, nicht nur in NY, sondern auch in Andrews Unterkunft."
2463,513218,2021-05-14,Thank you!
2464,507667,2021-10-08,Very great listing. Clean modern and convenient to travel around the city

2470,870835,2021-07-12,This place is a great clean place to be able to relax and venture off into the city!!! Caroline was so accommodating with us and even when I left something at the home after check out she held it for me until I could come get it! I am forever thankful for that! If you need anything just contact her and she will help!
2471,641031,2019-05-06,"The hosts, Dawn and Adam, are charming and helpful.  The apartment is very clean and attractive.  The room is small and could use somewhere to hang clothes.  Also a better mattress and window covering might help.  I am also not use to sharing a bathroom so that had some inconveniences.  Hosts were able to give us a sense of privacy although the room was small.  The location was perfect for us as it was only a few blocks from our family so we might go back to this space again."
2472,883207,2021-10-26,"Clean, comfortable, easy to get around. Angel could not have been more helpful."
2473,497051,2019-10-22,"Rachel was so accommodating during our stay, even when we needed to add a few people for some of the nights that we stayed in her place. Anything you need, Rachel is happy to provide including blankets, umbrellas, towels, you name it. I appreciate her making us so comfortable and being there to explain or help anytime we needed her. We found some extra ingredients in the fridge that helped with some of the things we cooked and that was a major plus. My one single tiny small suggestion might be a microwave. Everything else: perfect!"
2474,876271,2021-11-22,"This is a gorgeous apartment in a fabulous location.  Our host, Kerlly, welcomed us as we unloaded our bags and even volunteered to give us her parking space on the street ( fortunately, we found another one!).  She let us know that she was readily available if we needed anything. I heartily recommend this spacious apartment and I know we will be coming back again!   Karen"
2475,497444,2019-01-15,"Great location, great communication."

2477,713314,2019-11-12,"When there is a Dog you have to pay more attention to cleanliness. There was hair in Bedroom and under the bed. The place was super hot and got a little smelly, But if you are looking for a cheap place in NYC this is the place."
2478,632626,2021-05-31,Good location and cozy stay! Host was very helpful with questions and updates
2479,625262,2021-09-06,Very clean place.
2480,510656,2021-05-04,"Julie’s place is quintessential Brooklyn: a beautiful brownstone on a quiet, tree-lined street just steps from Prospect Park.  This is a serene place to launch your adventures into the city.  Julie is a delightful host who is eager to help if asked but who also hangs back and lets you do your thing when you want.  The grey bedroom is small but serviceable, very quiet since it is at the back of the house.  I had to work some days during my stay and had a desk and adequate internet.  I enjoyed playing with the two young cats, Winston and Clementine.  Great stay!"
2481,660951,2020-03-16,Vikki's home was so delightful.  Bright and clean and roomy for a couple and our college-aged daughter.  There is a patio that would have been nice in warmer weather.  Several cute restaurants and bars within easy walking distance.  We explored Prospect Park and highly recommend coffee at Relationships! <br/><br/>Our trip was cut short due to COVID shutting down flights and such but both Vikki and AirBNB were very helpful in refunding a portion of our stay.  Our son lives nearby in Brooklyn so we will definitely return to Vikki's lovely home in the future.
2482,481821,2019-09-30,"Very nice apartment, well furnished and clean, in a strategic area of the neighborhood. The proximity to the train doesn't bother at all, because all the windows are facing the backyard, on the opposite side, so the noise is barely perceived.<br/>The host is very courteous, helpful and fast responding. Highly recommended"
2483,581006,2019-10-19,Great private and clean space for staying in Brooklyn! Brenda was quick to all responses through Air BnB and was a very attentive host.
2484,769052,2020-08-19,Great little apartment very very clean stylish and up-to-date quiet comfortablecall around just a great little apartment if you need somewhere to stay in that neighborhood don't pass it up and the host was great communication was excellent
2485,31063,2020-01-31,公寓位置挺好的，步行2分钟有6号线地铁站，对面有警察局，也很安全。附近超市，洗衣房，加油站都很近。<br/>房子设施齐全，跟图片展示一样。两人使用空间宽裕。餐具厨具都比较全，有问题房东都及时回复。<br/>住了6晚偶尔自己买东西做做饭，过的比较舒适。比住酒店好很多！
2486,874903,2021-10-16,"Guys was so nice and helpful.<br/>Area is very quiet and very near to public buses, also 15 mins from F or E lines of subway.<br/>Building is safe."
2487,31943,2019-01-29,"My husband and I enjoyed our stay, it was very spacious and in a great location. Sundiata was kind and quick with communication. Would recommend."
2488,734297,2019-08-15,Wonderful real Brooklyn experience.
2489,735443,2021-11-01,"Amazing, cozy apartment in a perfect location in the LES. So many great restaurants and bars nearby, and walking distance to the subway to get around Manhattan. Our stay over Halloween was great, and Corey was quick to help out with everything!"
2490,463500,2021-05-02,"A most wonderful stay! I was here for about 6 weeks with my girlfriend and we enjoyed every minute of it! Great hospitable hosts, trains near, Target near, close to many areas, loved cooking in the kitchen, quiet atmosphere for relaxing evenings, overall quite a pleasant experience!"
2491,407563,2019-06-14,"The place is spotless clean,  in a safe neighborhood. Room is small but has everything you need and even more. The host is very kind person, she made a breakfast for us and shared a few pieces of advice about nyc."
2492,789267,2021-07-19,"Jake/Alan's place was wonderful.  Spotlessly clean, kitchen was well stocked, AC worked wonderfully (it was 90+ when we were there and very humid).  The umbrellas were a nice touch since it did rain a bit while we were there. The beds were amazingly comfortable, I slept SO well. There were some lovely touches that we really appreciated, and we asked Alan for some restaurant recommendations and they were really great.  The location is great, there's a full grocery store right at the corner (not a bodega like on most corners), great restaurants within walking distance. Note that it is a 5th floor walk-up (which is 4 flights of steps), which was fine for us.  The apartment is really quiet, since it is on the rear side of the building, so no street noise, which is a huge bonus in NY where it can get very noisy if you are on the street side of the building. Alan was extremely reliable in his communications and responded immediately to any inquiries we had.  I would definitely recommend this place if you are staying in NY."
2493,742413,2021-02-21,"The pros - very clean, great location - anything you could need is within walking distance, the place is huge for an nyc apartment, travel size bath products and toilet paper provided, the bed in the bedroom is extremely hard (I liked it) if you like a softer surface take the futon. The cons - WiFi and tv both never worked, when I asked the owner I was instructed on how to trouble shoot - still never worked for the entire stay, the person that lives on the 1st floor BLASTS the tv well into the morning (2am and beyond one night. There weren’t any seasonings or real blankets, just sheets and a thin hotel style duvet thing. Lastly, heat is controlled by the owner so be prepared to get VERY hot in the winter time."
2494,818577,2021-04-06,it was clean
2495,524865,2019-11-17,Femi and his family are responsive and very hospitable.  The space is comfortable and clean. Having a parking space available in NYC is very valuable especially late at nights. <br/>If you are squeamish about location you may want to check local reviews before booking this apartment.  The lockbox and lock needed some figuring out. There are house rules as well that seems a little invasive such as no partying. The TV's are difficult to figure out and seems to have access issues.  I couldn't even get a news channel to work without interruptions. There are some house rules with how high you can turn up the heat and owners expect the guests to clean up and sort and take out garbage. <br/> Overall we were satisfied and have no complaints. It was a pleasant stay and I would recommend Femi's place 4.5 out of 5.
2496,302883,2019-04-25,Quentin’s place was perfect. Everything was as described and it was very clean and homely. The apartment was not far from Times Square or Hudson yards. 10/10 would stay again! X
2497,482928,2019-03-22,"Petra is a fantastic host! Very friendly and considerate. She’s also easy to communicate with. The room is very nice and cozy, with its own private kitchen and everything you need if you feel like cooking. Very conveniently located at 5 minutes away form the subway. <br/>I highly recommend staying at Petra’s!"

2505,668188,2019-08-09,"Boris’s place is about 6 minutes walking distance away from a subway station so it’s perfect if you don’t have plans to get a car during your stay here. It was clean and lovely, perfect for 1-2 people."
2506,524871,2020-01-01,"Femis’s apartment is located at a very convenient location.<br/><br/>It is clean, and very well equipped. He left bagels, juice and coffee which we appreciated.<br/><br/>We liked that we could park inside the property  since finding a parking in New York is not easy.<br/><br/>In the future when I come back to New York I hope that Femis’s house is available because definitely I  would love to stay in that same apartment."
2507,790549,2020-12-20,"Amazing location in a great part of Brooklyn. The house is vintage yet modern, lovely space. All the amenities added a special touch to the trip. Everyone was able to be comfortable and have their own space. Anne is also a great host in terms of communication."
2508,553975,2019-06-16,Nice place.  Avoid walking from the Myrtle Ave/Broadway Metro stop late at night.
2509,808887,2021-06-27,Everything was as advertised and Melissa and a great host
2510,784227,2020-08-14,"Sumeira’s place has a private entrance which is great for those who seek privacy. It’s small and cozy, has everything you would need to make your stay comfortable. There’s even thoughtful touches like teas, coffee, water and oatmeal. The place looks just like the pictures and isn’t so far from the train station. Astoria park is just a couple blocks away so if you want to watch sunset or sunrise with a great view, it’s definitely something worth doing. Definitely would book again!"
2511,687802,2019-10-05,Great place to stay!
2512,711841,2019-10-10,Best place in Jackson Heights
2513,341750,2021-05-07,SJ’s place was perfect for my 2 week stay. It was extremely clean. The kitchen was well stocked with cooking utensils and spices. The bed was super comfortable. The location is great. Close to lots of restaurants and markets. <br/><br/>SJ was extremely responsive to all requests. <br/><br/>I would stay here again.
2514,872049,2021-09-28,It was clean and tidy place And close to many buses and subway stations.<br/><br/>It is not quite neighborhood .
2515,497452,2019-03-23,"Cool and safe area (close to everything : subway on the same street and shops/restaurants/coffees around), nice loft and a lovely host always ready to help. Thanks so much Sam !"

2517,839466,2021-10-31,Another great stay
2518,622936,2020-11-24,"I had a great stay at Hyacinth's place. She and her son Ricardo were both very hospitable hosts that made me feel well cared for the entire time. The space itself was very nice - it had a bedroom with an attached living room, which was great for an extended stay and very much worth it and nice for the price. It was in a quiet area and I was never bothered by noise. There was very little noise in the building itself, as well. Hyacinth checked in periodically to make sure I was cared for and that there weren't any issues."
2519,742887,2021-05-15,Comfortable and close to subway
2520,815429,2020-06-15,"The place was great! I loved the check in/check out system which allowed for a seamless experience. The room was clean, the windows overlooking the front of the bldg allowed for some nice views. Definitely would do again."
2521,792553,2021-01-24,"LITERALLY WORTH EVERY PENNY AND MORE!!! Sharriq was super generous and made sure all my needs were met. The house is spacious, well decorated, and fully equipped. If I could give 10 stars I would. Highly recommend and I will definitely book a stay here again."
2522,685827,2019-04-14,Decent place in a neighborhood I wasn’t really familiar with. Perfect for me. I was just looking for a place to crash and didn’t plan on spending time there. The photo of the room shows a television and there was no television. I wasn’t there to watch TV so it didn’t matter at all to me
2523,811518,2021-02-28,Great location. Very clean. I would definitely stay here again.
2524,673812,2020-01-09,"Juste excellent!!! <br/>Nous avons adoré l’appartement de Leigh! <br/>Nous avons loué, mon mari, ma fille de 2 ans et moi, son appartement pendant trois semaines, au moment des fêtes de fin d’année. Je crois que nous avons passé un des plus merveilleux Noël de notre vie. <br/>L’appartement est vraiment beau et décoré avec énormément de goût. Il est chaleureux et typique des appartements de Brooklyn. Il est propre, possède tout ce dont on peut avoir besoin et il se trouve à côté de 3 stations de métro différentes. La plus éloignée se trouve à seulement 10-12 minutes du logement à pied. Leigh est disponible et répond très rapidement à nos messages. <br/>Bref, nous recommandons ce logement à 100% et nous espérons pouvoir y revenir un jour."
2525,482857,2021-08-25,"Maria's apartment is a great place to call home when staying in Brooklyn. It is reasonably priced, clean, in an awesome location, and had all the necessary amenities. While some complained of noise, we had no issues other than the occasional upstairs footsteps. We would absolutely stay again, and recommend it to others as well."
2526,826968,2021-08-13,"Aida and Manuel are kind and welcoming hosts.  The room is large and comfortable.  The neighborhood is quiet, but still close to a nice variety of restaurants.  I would recommend to anyone."
2527,345947,2021-02-15,"Great stay. We have stay at this location before and it does not disappoint. Definitely, worth it."
2528,681419,2021-09-22,We had a great time staying at Mikes place! It was in a great location that made it easy to walk to the deli or take public transportation into the city!
2529,606438,2019-01-02,"Nice place, perfect location, very easy access to Williamsburg downtown. Super easy check in and out. Very quick responses from the owner. Overall great stay, would definitely book again."
2530,796445,2020-01-20,"This space was mostly fine. The location is good and it's reasonably clean. The rooms are small -- the four of us were not comfortably able to sit in the living room area. But the biggest issue was the bathtub -- it clogged after 3 of us took showers on our first morning (short showers, <10 mins) and still hadn't drained until our departure two days later. I messaged Sam about this multiple times and he said he was trying to find a plumber, but the fact remains that we were unable to take a shower for two days. I find this unacceptable and was not pleased with this state of things."
2531,758939,2019-09-02,It was a nice place to stay for the weekend with friends and family.  5/5
2532,141069,2021-07-26,"We really enjoyed our stay at Rhonda’s place in Bed-Stuy. The apartment was clean, welcoming, and the perfect size for two travelers (queen sized bed and futon). The apartment is located on a residential street but has easy access to bus stops and subway stations, both a short walk away, as well as local coffee shops and eateries. Rhonda was awesome - very responsive and accommodating. We can’t wait to come back."
2533,208818,2019-05-04,You can definitely expect a very comfortable stay here
2534,373442,2020-10-18,"Exactly as pictured, super clean, and great hospitality! Very bright space with all the necessary amenities. Gravel path and narrow, full-flight of stairs to enter. We used street parking and were able to park near the house every time. Beth was very welcoming and helpful! Our only things to note was that the loft space in a little shorter than it appears (my partner is 6ft, comfortable lying down but must crawl to edge), the bed was fairly hard, and the train and low flying planes were very noisy (if you aren’t used to it). Highly recommend this space if you want to stay in the area and we would love to stay again!"
2535,860071,2021-11-08,Great place to stay for a visit to Brooklyn. Convenient subway locations make an easy commute to Manhattan as well. Apartment was very clean and Jessica was a great host.
2536,505486,2021-11-19,Cheap place. Expect what you pay for. It’s not the best place I’ve stayed at but it’s somewhere to sleep at night.
2537,550318,2019-07-12,"Very nice stay! Super clean and cool place to stay if traveling to NYC. Wish my stay was longer, that’s how much I enjoyed the stay. Would recommend this stay to anyone whose visiting the city."
2538,751000,2019-08-16,"Sadie was wonderful, super communicative, and her place is beautiful. 5 stars, and would definitely recommend!!"
2539,853434,2021-05-31,Mr Aqeel was so great communication was great anything i needed he was responding in 2 mins . the beds were so comfortable and the place was very clean. Nice great area. I would recommend this place to anyone. Thank you so much wish i could give more then 5 stars
2540,700741,2019-05-01,This was one of the best Air B&B’s I’ve been to. Carolyn was so accommodating. She literally thought of everything and provided a very warm and comforting stay. Everything was convenient and lovely.
2541,848709,2021-07-04,"Booked Kathy’s apartment for my family’s visit to Park Slope. They appreciated how clean, spacious and comfortable the apartment is. The apartment is nicely decorated with plenty of thoughtful amenities! Great for a weekend stay if you’re looking for lodging in the area but I’d also imagine it’s great for a longer stay."
2542,548294,2019-05-14,"Lara es muy amable y habla muy bien el español, queremos regresar pronto a NY y nos encantaría fuera en el mismo lugar. <br/><br/>Gracias Lara por hacer de este viaje algo especial."
2543,56577,2020-01-19,Amy’s place was perfect and I’ll definitely be staying again in the future
2544,761941,2020-01-20,"Le chauffage est « dangereux », prise électrique à proximité, montage souple, pas assez rassurant en terme de sécurité... Le froid passe à travers les fenêtres, il faudrait trouver une solution pour cela. <br/><br/>Mise à part cela, le logement est petit pour 5 mais fonctionnel, situé à proximité à 5min du métro 110 street Cathedral Parkway et 10min à pied de central Park nord ouest. Il faut compter 15 min de métro pour être à Times Square."
2545,217684,2021-09-13,"Pros: <br/>- Very close to a bus stop that will take you to the subway (less than a block)<br/>- Close to the Bayside LIRR (maybe a mile or so)<br/>- Bed was very comfortable <br/>- Fans were available in every room <br/>- Coffee via a Keurig was available along with dishes, microwave, mini fridge, etc. <br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- Too far from the subway. It was a 30 minute bus ride to the subway station in Flushing then another 30 minutes into Manhattan. <br/>- Tv was very basic cable. Would’ve been nice to have a smartTV so we could have accessed Netflix, Hulu, etc.<br/>- Professional cleaning is needed. The place was surface cleaned but mirrors were streaky, film on the shower, etc. <br/>- A little worn. Could use a new couch and the desk was broken. <br/><br/>Overall it was a good place to sleep for a few nights. Emmanuel was a welcoming host and answered all questions we had."
2546,707354,2019-02-28,Good luck if you are traveling with friends and you want to talk or laugh or listen to music this needs to be a trip for quite business trip only
2547,347786,2021-11-27,"This place is an Airbnb gem.  Exactly as pictured and very spacious.  Both the bed and huge leather sofa are really comfy.  The Bedford train is right outside your door, and there’s a ton of great restaurants, convenience stores, and shops within walking distance.  We didn’t cook because we wanted to eat our way through NYC, but if you did, the kitchen is stocked with pots, pans, knives, and utensils.  If you plan to stay in the Williamsburg area, this place can’t be beat."
2548,756423,2020-01-01,Thank you for accepting us to stay here even it was the same-day reservation and check-in. We had very nice holidays here with your cute cat and doggie.
2549,779754,2020-08-16,"Beautiful place!  The view is amazing, especially at night -  great view of New York.   Artwork was delightful and interesting.  Place was a museum within itself.   Thanks again!"
2550,407427,2020-03-01,"Todo excelente, buena ubicación, limpieza e instrucciones claras."
2551,743079,2021-05-10,"If you are going in group, this place is ok for it because of the size and the number of beds. The kitchen and living room is decent. There’s a whole in the kitchen that I wasn’t aware of it, the towels that are provided have stain and don’t look as clean as they supposed too. As for the WiFi, if your bedroom is at the front of the house then you lucky to have WiFi. If your bedroom is located in the back of the house, then you won’t have no connection.  When booking this place, it says free parking on premises but when I arrived I had to huddle every night to park my rental car. I had to sit out by the window waiting for someone to move their car so my car won’t be staying on the street. When I asked the host if I can park on the side, he told me no and if I do his neighbor will towed my car. Mind you there’s a two car garage in the back and two parking spaces on the side of the house, that had been empty until the day I left.<br/>I paid almost $2000 to stay there so I can attend my auntie funeral. I specifically book this Airbnb because it says it offer WiFi and parking on premise so I can do my work and my sisters can do their zoom classes. And I can park the rental with a peace of mind that nothing will happen to it. <br/>Yes it’s a long review but in my experience I wasn’t happy. And the whole time I was staying there, I never see the host even telling him about all of those problems."
2552,217839,2019-02-02,"We liked the apartment, it has all you need. It is easy to get into the city. It takes about 20 to 30 minutes depends where you are heading. The subway station, a grocery store and restaurants are also very close by.<br/>Very good choice for a city trip to NY!"
2553,806939,2021-05-07,"Great place with great value! Very quiet, very clean! I highly recommend this place!"
2554,697411,2021-11-28,"A very nice and clean host! He can communicate and made our stay as convenient as possible. Also, it was very clean and the location was great. Next time, I will pick the same airbnb."
2555,499376,2019-04-18,"Хороший вариант для того, чтобы провести пару ночей. Метро в двух шагах, поэтому ночью шумят поезда."

2558,341133,2019-06-03,The accommodation of Pika can be recommended. Roosvelt Island is perfect for a stay away from Manhattan. The great skyline of Manhattan and the somewhat quieter environment offer relaxation and recreation after the hustle and bustle in Manhattan.<br/>The hosts are very nice and helpful. The accommodation can be recommended. The value for money for New York is great.
2559,794474,2021-09-23,Excellent place easy to get to
2560,720774,2019-11-03,"Michaelle’s apartment was well-stocked with drinks and snacks, and it was spotless. Easy walk from the subway, and Michaelle helped with transportation tips and things to do in the area. Would absolutely stay again!"
2561,887639,2021-10-12,"I stayed at Isa's place for 3 days. The place is located near the metro station, pretty much 6 minutes walking. There are a lot of nice places around and convenience stores. Isa is an awesome host, he is very accomodating, very friendly, very professional, and very nice. He is easy going and his place is well maintained and clean. He was always helpful whenever I ask him any questions about the places or asking him for help. He made me a Turkish tea that is super tasty. If I get back to visit NYC, I will surely stay at his place. <br/>Thanks Isa"
2562,735473,2019-09-04,"Perfect, the house conforms to the description, the host is reactive and good advice. It’s close to metro line 7 and the neighborhood is cool."

2575,862501,2021-08-31,"We had a wonderful stay in this apartment! Jennifer and Justin were super communicative and responsive. The apartment is well decorated with lots of plants and had everything we needed. There’s some good food places nearby and you’re a 10 min walk from the J or the L train. It’s also very pet friendly, which our pup appreciated."
2576,671982,2020-01-03,Un peu éloigné du centre de la ville. Un temps de transport entre 1h et 1h30 pour se rendre sur les lieux de visite. Le studio est agréable à vivre.
2577,890438,2021-11-18,This is the real deal. As good as it gets on cleanliness and location. Definitely will always stay here when I’m in town.
2578,464986,2021-04-04,"Chito and Javier’s place is stylish and clean, and they are wonderful and communicative hosts! They went the extra mile to help out when I left my phone in a Lyft in another city. I was on the move during my NYC visit and they kept an eye out for my overnight package and got it to me safely. Great communication, service and style. Thanks again to you both!"

2581,599532,2020-03-12,Super clean! Very beautiful space to stay out of you’re in the Staten Island location. 100% would recommend this spot to a friend.
2582,760630,2020-07-20,Ashley’s home was wonderful!! It was extremely clean and comfortable. Her home is in a very good neighborhood. I was able to cook a great meal and relax with my family. The communication was great between us and she gave us all the privacy we could ask for! I would definitely recommend Ashley’s place for a great stay away from home.
2583,510765,2019-09-22,"We stayed in Janet and Cheri’s for two nights. The check in was very quick and easy. Also, the hosts gave very detailed instructions and answered me very fast:) The apartment is very clean and spacious, also it is located very close to subway and grocery shop. There are a lot if nice pictures and paintings in the apartment. Janet and Cheri are very hospitable people and gave us some tips concerning best places in NYC."

2586,738852,2019-10-14,"Ché est très réactif et agréable.  Concernant l’appartement, il est très central, fonctionnel, mais il ne faut pas s’attendre à un appartement de rêve !! Ne tardez pas à réserver quand même, ici.;)"
2587,384056,2021-04-10,Carla place made our stay very comfortable. Her entire place extremely clean and her beds linen as well very comfortable. Overall the area of the apartment is small but very functional for the three of us. thank you again.
2588,872881,2021-08-29,Beautiful space! Communication was amazing! We would definitely stay there again
2589,771055,2019-10-21,We really enjoyed staying at Gilmar's place! He was very easy to communicate with. The space was clean and stylish and conveniently located to the subway station. Would highly recommend!
2590,870823,2021-07-31,Was fine. The camera following you around the kitchen/hallway is kinda weird. Sufficient for a short term stay but wouldn’t recommend this place for longer stays.
2591,891009,2021-10-24,Clean and comfy place. We had a wonderful stay.
2592,566698,2019-03-16,"Very nice place, great for layovers and more!"

2594,599490,2019-05-13,"I have now stayed at Sebastian’s place multiple times and each has been nothing short of a wonderful experience!  His place is chic, clean, cozy, quiet, safe and he never fails to add those special touches making your stay even that much better.  As I’ve said in previous reviews, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND booking at Sebastian’s place.  Thanks Sebastian!"
2595,323653,2019-06-13,Fantastic place!!! As lovely as you see in the photos!! Clean as a whistle and packed with all the amenities you could want. Located within a couple of minutes to the subway line and to a grocery store. Ben and Anna communicated swiftly on any inquiry we had and were always happy to help us and gave great local tips! Would highly recommend and would certainly stay again!
2596,362056,2019-03-05,great place for the price would recommend it definitely.
2597,627186,2021-10-10,The place was just how it was described. Highly recommend
2598,803239,2021-04-28,"Overall, this is a spectacular place. The location, space, neighborhood, cleanliness, hosts, and value were all 5 star. Highlights were the second sleeping / entertaining space with a bathroom in the windowless basement, the neighborhood, and the value. With the basement space we were able to meet our 22 year old son in NYC for a short trip and we were all happy in our space. We didn't use the kitchen for anything other than the refrigerator and a couple of reheating tasks. We didn't use the laundry - but longer stay guests will also enjoy those amenities. The neighborhood has good transportation options - subway is relatively close, CitiBikes are closer, ample utility shopping, great restaurants, coffee shops, bakeries, wine shops, playgrounds, and a few bars."
2599,231121,2020-01-19,"A great apartment on the Upper West Side. Pictures don’t do it justice - the apartment is roomy and has high ceilings.  It’s also very quiet, no noise coming in from the street. 2 people can sleep in the bedroom bed, plus there is a pull out sofa in the living room that can serve as a second bed. The sofa was fine for me but it’s not the most comfortable one. I think this apartment would be ideal for two people where sofa is used as a couch. A perfect location for visiting the city. At least two large grocery stores very close by, which is exceptional for NYC. Subway is at the end of the street. <br/>Jay is a great host. The check in/ check out process was smooth and Jay was available to answer any questions. He also offered to help with luggage and was very nice and helpful throughout our entire 12 day stay. Thank you."
2600,809334,2021-01-10,Clean space.<br/><br/>Warm bed. <br/><br/>Warm running water. <br/><br/>All in Midtown Manhattan with excellent access to just about anything in the city. And very affordable price compared the nearby hotels and other air BnB places. 5 outta 5
2601,888083,2021-11-28,"This apartment is a real find.  In an historic Brooklyn brownstone with lots of character, the apartment is beautifully outfitted and very comfortable.  You have everything you need and then some.  It is located in a safe neighborhood near every major subway line so you can get anywhere in New York City with ease.  There are great restaurants, coffee shops, and shopping all within easy walking distance.  Rebecca is a gracious host and very responsive.   I hope to stay here again and again in my trips back to New York."
2602,888059,2021-10-31,"Charlie's place was perfect for my long weekend in New York. I used to live in the neighborhood and the location was perfect for visiting local friends and for getting on the train into manhattan to swing by my office. The apartment was clean and spacious, washed in sunlight and very comfortable. I don't know when I'll be back, but i'll be booking again.<br/><br/>- Travis"

It's also walking distance to the Botanical Gardens, the BK Museum and Prospect Park. Saturdays there is a great farmer's market at the top of the park. Sooki was super quick to respond to any of our questions. We enjoyed our time in her space."

2609,753431,2021-08-20,"Everything was good with Asil condo, I guess for New York prices he’s Place is sure good value for money. The only downside was the homeless people that sit on the steps, they are harmless,. The upside is close to to Penn station, Central Park and Broadway."
2610,407997,2019-05-17,"This was a modern, large apartment. Having the two full bathrooms was a great for 4 adults. It really needs some management care. It was not as clean as it should have been. There were some amenities missing. Lamps by the bedside would have been really nice. A more complete dish ware and silverware collection would have been nice. Future renters should be aware that’s it’s 2 1/2 flights of stairs to the apartment. All in all, it was sufficient for the amount of time we spent there. Tasha was easy to talk to and quickly addressed a problem we had with unswept floors."
2611,705973,2019-09-25,Vistas muy buenas desde el salón y la habitación. Cama muy cómoda y buena comunicación con los autobuses
2612,816785,2021-09-06,"This space is so beautiful. The block is gorgeous. The location is divine. Great coffee and wine shops. Amazing bagels. <br/><br/>It felt like we were house sitting for a friend away on a trip. It felt like a lived-in space rather than some of the sterile, bare options on here. It is a cute, artsy space. The patio is amazing. You’ll love it!<br/><br/>The only downside are the beds and the bed linens. A little uncomfortable. We had three people hoping to sleep in separate beds and while three beds were listed only two were in the space. And one was on the floor."

2618,861255,2021-05-16,"Lauren’s home was very welcoming and comfortable. It’s clear it’s her regular residence but we were able to feel comfortable amongst her personal items. Backyard space is lovely, though shared with the upstairs neighbor which is an important thing to know when booking (this did not bother us, just relevant info). After our stay Lauren reported damage we did not cause which we are working on sorting out."
2619,820767,2021-11-07,"The host is amazing. She went out of the way to personally greet us although we were very early. Customer service doesn’t get better than this.

Vous avez également accès au toit terrasse avec une vue magnifique sur la ville et une table. La station de métro qui relie directement Manhattan est à moins de 10min. Britt a était très réactive lorsque nous avions une question et vous pourrez en prime visiter sa boutique de bijoux. En résumé un voyage inoubliable et un Airbnb de charme ou nous reviendrons avec grand plaisir. <br/><br/>A noté que cela ne nous a pas dérangé mais pour les personnes sensibles aux bruits, l'appartement est situé en plein centre avec beaucoup de passage."

2645,783162,2021-05-26,"The first thing I want to impress upon anyone who may be undecided is that this location is just excellent! The people are amazing and kind as can be. Everything is within walking distance,  the zoo, restaurants of all kinds, stores for anything you need and even an amazing little pharmacy to help nurse your feet if you're like us and don't generally walk 20 miles in a 2 day span.  The apartment is great, clean and provides a great quiet place to rest, relax and recharge. Our favorite spot was the front porch steps where we watched the flurry of activity each night. The sights, the sounds and absolutely the memories we will cherish forever."

El alojamiento es amplio pero el estado de conservación deja un poco que desear...desconchones en la pared, en la bañera, escaso mobiliario y menaje. Christine estuvo pendiente de nosotros vía mensajes y amablemente nos dejó dejar las maletas hasta nuestro regreso al aeropuerto ."
2650,566735,2019-08-23,Couldn’t recommend enough. Place is great if you’re looking to crash for the night.

David et un hôte disponible, accueillant et sympathique."
2655,1491,2019-08-05,Great location in Brooklyn. Close to trendy bars and restaurants. Also close to the subway. We go lucky with free street parking.
2656,622250,2019-03-31,"A great space!  As you approach the building in Little Italy, you will probably think, ""this is going to be noisy ...""  NOT AT ALL.  The apartment is at the back of the building and is very quiet.  Soft bed and pillows, great shower head, lots of hot water.  Robert is easy to communicate with and I had no issues accessing the building while he was out.  Highly recommend."

2670,811155,2020-11-22,"Personally had no problems with the apartment. Gorgeous view and location. The sofa is exceptionally uncomfortable and broken and the apartment is kind of bare, but there is a decent amount of room especially for a NYC apt. <br/><br/>Hosts are super weird. Jana kept texting me prior to my arrival regarding the key exchange. She was double and triple texting me if I didn’t respond within 10 minutes. Like girl, I work. Also she texted me during my visit asking if she could pick up something from the apartment which I thought was super unprofessional. <br/><br/>Overall decent stay but don’t expect anything special."
2671,404816,2019-11-11,"The house is convenient if you are flying in or out of LGA airport. Definitely walk to the house - it's a 10-15 minute walk. There's a lot of space to spread out, which was also nice. However, the floors are very thin so beware if you are not an especially heavy sleeper. We stayed for two nights and had pretty poor sleep both nights. Motion sensor lights in every room were jarring at nighttime. It's an older house that has been inexpertly redone so there are lots of quirks."
2672,620926,2019-02-25,"My wife and i have stayed in a bunch of airbnbs in the city, but always wanted to be in the village.<br/>Christopher's place on Christopher St. is a great apartment in an excellent location - We were 4 people  - two couples- and it worked out fine.<br/>I highly recommend and would gladly book again."

2676,744471,2021-06-13,"My experience in Sugar Hill was excellent. Mary was quick to address a minor issue. I enjoyed having a kitchen, TV with Netflix, a nearby grocery store, corner shop, extremely close transit, and a Citi Bike dock. Try the French toast at the nearby Sugar Hill Cafe while you are there and be sure to walk to the waterfront for a sunset."
2677,876678,2021-08-23,Such an awesome place to stay in the Lower East Village :)
2678,690488,2019-03-15,"Andrew’s place is the cutest spot. Although it is a private room not the whole apartment he gives you ample privacy.

2688,693637,2019-11-10,Perfect location and place for a weekend getaway. Super lovely apartment and the hosts were courteous and gave us our space. There were some hiccups in the cleanliness however that did make us feel as though the space was not 100% prepared for our arrival. The price is too good to beat. Would recommend and stay again.
2689,707471,2021-10-30,"Great host & great space!  As a creative , I loved the art & decor. Everything within the space was intentional & thoughtful. The outdoor space was also nice to have when wanting to get some fresh air. I look forward to staying here again."

Nice, quiet area with plenty of restaurants in walking distance.   The subway was a quick walk from the apartment and Grand Central was a 5 minute ride away.  The apartment was clean and had everything we needed for our 4 night stay.  We would not hesitate to return."
2696,635790,2021-06-14,"Pablo and Ju's space is absolutely magical. So magical in fact, that we literally had trouble leaving every morning due to their magnetic book collection and decor. The location was great, as it's steps away from the subway. This (and the lively neighborhood) makes it quite loud at times, and although I quite enjoyed it myself, if you need absolute silence to sleep, you should definitely think about bringing ear plugs. Pablo himself was quite accomodating and communicative, by the way. We didn’t get to meet him unfortunately but he was always in contact. Overall the experience was perfection. 100% recommend. I'll likely stay here if it's available next time I'm back."

2723,766454,2020-10-18,Perfect for our weekend in Brooklyn. It was located close to everything we needed. Would definitely stay here again.
2724,324188,2019-07-28,Clean home and close to subway and amenities. Good value.
2725,521539,2019-11-14,"Shuly's place was super clean and stylish, and the location and parking were great. If you want a spotless, hip stay and a small comfy room (bed and desk) this place is a gem."
2726,228699,2021-06-17,"John's place was exactly the oasis I was looking for when staying in Brooklyn. Everything was super clean and simple, all the traditional amenities were present, and the kitchen was fully stocked (and actually usable! not just ""here are some pots and pans"").  The location is fantastic, in my opinion. Myrtle Ave is alive and vibrant with so many places to eat and drink, there is a selection of grocers and supermarkets nearby. Fort Greene park is a 5-10 minute walk, and the subway is a 15-20 minute walk (depending on how fast/patient you are).<br/><br/>And for others like me that are working remotely, wi-fi was fast and reliable!<br/><br/>Checking in with John was super simple and he was there to greet me in person and chat to get to know each other a bit, which I really appreciated. John was kind and responsive, and in my opinion, is the kind of host that keeps me using Airbnb.<br/><br/>Thanks again John!"

2730,226177,2019-08-14,"O's place is located in the heart and soul of NY's Greenwich Village just steps from Washington Square Park.  Even though there's so much happening outside, the apartment is in the back of the building so you can sink into the comfy bed for a nice sleep without being disturbed.  Beyond the location, the place has all that you need to cook and super fast internet.  O realized during my stay that the router wasn't putting out the desired mbps and had a new one before I could even mention it.  I could go on and on but I think anyone reading this will get the idea.  O really cared whether I was comfortable, happy and well looked after...  I recommend this place highly."
2731,761786,2021-05-31,"The stay was ok. It’s in a convenient location , so getting to things was easy HOWEVER, the overall value of the place is not very good . The place was not clean properly at all. The furniture was in a deplorable condition.  Very dingy furniture . The shower was nice but not cleaned which brought down the value of the place especially the toilet bowl was not clean at all . Also the place was very cold i was trembling the entire time . This place has great potential to be better  with better maintenance. Stay at your convenience."

2742,635019,2019-09-11,"We had a very nice stay at Carles’ townhouse ! We were warmly welcomed by Han who explained us everything we needed to know. Carles was very helpful with us when we needed a vacuum cleaner or when we had issues with the oven... The communication was excellent, fast and efficient. The neighborhood was quiet and authentic, we only had to walk 5min to the subway which took us to Midtown Manhattan within 30min and to JFK in less than an hour. The apartment was well decorated and the bed was so comfortable, we really enjoyed it ! However the whole appartement could have been much cleaner, the bedroom and the bathroom were okay but the living room and the kitchen were dirty (hairs everywhere, stains...). The kitchen was also poorly equipped and the dishwasher wasn’t working... <br/>It was nice to be able to let our luggage there during our last day after checking out. Overall it was a great stay, thanks again !"
2743,616814,2020-01-02,"Kelly's location was everything as advertised and more. She provided complimentary slippers and drink and went far above and beyond. From the cleanliness of the space to quick replies, I would recommend staying here to anyone coming to the area!"

2748,481954,2019-07-18,Great value! Location is awesome. East Village bars and restaurants are seconds away. My desire was good A/C and it was nice and cool during my stay. Check in was a little tricky but check out was easy. If all you need is a bed as a solo traveler then this place is great.

Very roomy by New York standards, it was the perfect staging point for my daughter and I when we moved her into college from out of state. The galley kitchen is absurdly well-equipped. The bathroom is bright, clean and modern, with a lovely shower. David is a gracious and responsive host. The apartment was super-clean, with fast WiFi and a dining table that was perfect for working remotely as well as a large flat screen smart TV with cable that was perfect for winding down at night by watching movies."
2755,88817,2019-05-19,"Kevin's place is in a beautiful old brownstone in Park Slope.  Kevin was easy to communicate with in advance of our stay and very kindly met us upon our arrival.  The location is ideal -  steps away from subway lines, great restaurants, bars, Prospect Park, etc. etc.  Although the bathroom/kitchen is shared, the rooms provided are separate from the rest of the apartment, spacious and private.  This is a great value for the location!"
2756,819342,2020-11-27,"This place was great! not fancy, but spotlessly clean and comfortable.  The bath mat was changed daily  which was unexpected, but nice. The host was very friendly and very helpful with recommending places to eat or shop in the area. I would definitely stay there again!"

Other than that, Tylor did his best to provide a great stay."

She really loved the place - how easy it is to get around, how Whole Foods is just one block away, how she quickly found her new favorite restaurant in NY around the corner, how quiet and peaceful the street is despite being in the city that never sleeps. Jessie is a wonderful host too! She met my friend for check-in and prepared a guide full of local tips. She’s very responsive and was so nice to extend the check-out time upon request. This place honestly has the best value for money in Manhattan! I’d highly recommended it for anyone visiting NY!"

2793,876606,2021-10-23,"The apartment is great for a short-term stay in the lower east side. The bedroom desk provides a space to work if necessary and the kitchen is stocked with the bare essentials for a home cooked meal. The bed is comfy and the air conditioning and heating unit are more than adequate to keep the apartment at a comfortable temperature. The closet provides more than enough space for storage and the unit is large enough for two to stay. For those working from home or seeking an extended stay, it was difficult given the lack of a door and natural light (due to basement unit, garden unit would be generous). The unit is located back from the street and was very quiet given the location and price for a short-term stay."
2794,882893,2021-09-10,The worst place I ever stayed with no privacy in the bedroom even in the bathroom!! And the owner is really rude. We was scared the whole time we was there and we got blamed for the stuff we never broke !

I appreciated the UHD TVs in the bedroom and living rooms. Try the Edge restaurant on Edgecombe. There’s a subway stop at 145th street & St. Nicholas for the ABC&D trains, and it’s also a short walk to Broadway and the 145th street stop for the 1 train."

2831,842835,2021-04-30,"Wonderful, clean apartment with great amenities in an excellent location in Park Slope. Perfect for a short term or long term stay!"
2832,753585,2021-08-17,"Great place, comfortable, well stocked with furniture, linens, appliances, kitchen, coffee, spices, a welcome bottle of wine, etc.  Good location in Brooklyn.  Easily can accomdate 3.  We'll suggest it tto our friends."
2833,820512,2021-07-11,"The place and location is amazing! It is about a one minute walk away from the subway station and the place was way bigger than expected. Sarah was very communicative for the entire stay and responded very quickly. There are shops nearby so everything was accessible. For the value, I would highly recommend!"
2834,794972,2021-11-15,Nir’s place was a great place to stay while in NYC. He greeted us when we arrived and showed us the place. It was clean and recently renovated. The location is great for anyone looking to venture around Brooklyn or even Queens. I definitely recommend it!
2835,752856,2019-07-16,Really nice place. Jesse was a fun person to communicate with. Really friendly. 10 out of 10 would recommend
2836,852986,2021-10-23,The apartment is very well located and the subway is just a few blocks away.  The room was clean and the bed was comfortable.  I didn't use the kitchen. Communication with the host was good.
2837,521261,2021-07-08,"Place is as described. Great value, clean space, and located conveniently on S.I.  I would stay again. The only negative I can say is that the mattress desperately needs to be changed, it is a completely done in for box spring mattress that you sink into a whole lot. Other than that great stay."
2838,462678,2019-11-30,Excelente ubicación
2839,207877,2019-05-02,"They are very nice, feels like in my home~"
2840,876197,2021-11-21,Rachel’s stay was so nice! It’s cute and cozy. She was really good at communicating and making sure we had everything we needed even if it meant dropping off a couple extra stuff. So sweet!!! It’s a little far from the train station and kinda far from city but worth it for the price. The shower takes some time to heat up but the flow was powerful and soothing. The beds were super comfortable. I was only sad there was no full length mirrors and it was a bit far. Walls are thin.
2841,636511,2020-01-01,"We loved staying at Owen’s apartment.! It’s such a nice place, very comfortable and clean. <br/><br/>We loved the location. Easy access to subway or walking distance to really nice spots. <br/><br/>Owen was a great host and available for any question at any moment."
2842,874114,2021-10-17,"Joann's place was clean. My only complaint is that the review mentions parking on premises when it's really street parking. We didn't have a problem finding parking, but street parking and ""parking on premises "" are 2 different things. <br/>This is a basement studio so if you're tall (over 6' 4"") this could be an issue. There are 2 poles in the middle not shown in the pics. Joann does provide water and other amenities which adds a nice touch."
2843,617535,2019-01-30,"The house is located in a safe and lovely  neighborhood, on quite a tranquil block.   It is a short two floor walk-up. The room was clean and tidy, with welcoming touches, such as a flourishing orchid on the sill, and two fresh towels within the room. Furthermore Rivka was quick to respond to my messages, and provided clear & accurate directions/instructions. Great experience, highly recommend."
2844,466807,2020-01-18,"I fell in love with this airbnb. Such a great location in the heart of Bushwick. Subway was right across the street and everything was just as described. It was clean and had everything i needed. Also this is perfect for those ones who needs some privacy even though there might be someone else in the apartment as well! Sometimes it felt like i was there just by myself even there was others. Thank you Dylana, you have such a good apartment to stay. I will come back. :)"
2845,780490,2021-10-23,"Obviously very cheap but the area isn’t great, you’re far from Manhattan and the rest of Brooklyn, the room really only suits one person otherwise you feel like an ogre, and the common area smelled like years of uncleaned pet odor. OH THERE’S A DOG DAYCARE NEXT DOOR so be prepared to listen to yapping dogs all day and night."
2846,474585,2019-01-19,Very convenient location and good hot shower - much appreciated after a very long flight. Definitely does the trick if you’re looking for something simple and functional.

2849,582590,2019-12-08,Space was great and good location - easy walk to the ferry so pretty quick access to Manhattan.  First time I had not stayed in Manhattan so I underestimated the amount of time I would spend commuting.  That’s all about my planning not Marks place.
2850,825504,2021-04-02,"Beautiful, very clean and communication was very easy. Definitely recommend this beautiful  place."

2854,89467,2019-05-06,Alles TOP!!! Immer wieder gerne!!!
2855,776519,2021-08-13,"Karina’s 3rd floor apartment was all that was advertised…clean, spacious and ideally located to subway and more importantly 3 blocks from our daughters new apartment! Not much to complain about…everything was great except the week we booked for was the hottest of the summer. No central air only one window unit which was located in the largest bedroom…great for sleeping at night but not so great when we wanted to hangout in the living room opposite the window unit. There’s nothing that could be done better by the hosts but it was HOT! Katrina thought of everything from shampoo/conditioner to q-tips! Thank you so much for our home-away-from-home in NYC Brooklyn!"

2863,299937,2019-09-22,"One of my favourite places I’ve stayed at so far on Airbnb, absolutely impressive stay and the location is closeby to the 116 train station. Close commute into the city and you have shops all around you on the streets. I felt at home staying at Angie’s, it was everything I expected!"

2865,797407,2021-07-11,"Great location, comfortable clean and private space, everything you’ll need for a pleasurable stay in Ridgewood, and easy access to Brooklyn too. Omar is a great host and has a wonderful space to share with us. Best value around."

2867,637985,2019-06-03,"Tim's place was great value. Tim was a gracious host, helped with our luggage and took us on a tour of the apartment showing us everything we needed to know. The place was clean, comfortable and close to buses, Staten island ferry with a convenience store next door. Off street parking is a bonus. Beautiful gardens and a lovely porch for morning coffee was wonderful. Would recommend this place to anyone who wants to be close to NYC."
2868,714200,2019-11-07,"Great stay, just like last time.  I travel into the city weekly and always look for this place.  Affordable, convenient and clean."
2869,788250,2021-02-13,Great Place- Lots of awesome amenities. Close to train like 5 secs and has great Indian food nearby.
2870,483930,2019-04-08,"Great host, very responsive to messages.  Easy to get to Manhattan from her place and neat bars nearby.  If you’re looking to stay in New York stay here!"
2871,823272,2021-04-27,"Great location near many small businesses and transportation (massage, supermarket, plants, clothes, food, a bridal shop + more cool spaces). Area is safe and a joy to walk around. The key  lock system felt secure and I was happy to see that the code is changed after every guest. I used this place to meditate and WFH. WiFi was strong, TV was easy to use with available already logged in apps, and I truly enjoyed the quietness and cleanliness of the home. The bed was top tier cozy. I wish the shower head had more water pressure but other than that - no complaints. The host was accommodating and quick to respond."
2872,887465,2021-10-04,Awesome space in a super hip location. Had everything I needed and no extra cost with frills I wouldn't use. Would absolutely stay here again in the future.

2874,878910,2021-08-10,"Great place to stay, the apartment is clean and lovely just enough room for a few days."
2875,387801,2019-06-18,"Our stay at Taran and Najla’s place was a wonderful experience! I am originally from NYC so this was a homecoming trip for my family. This was the best experience I’ve ever had coming back to NY for a visit. It’s a much better option than a cramped hotel or other places. The location was great for us, as we had family in Jamaica that we visited every day and it was a 30-45 minute drive into Manhattan every day, depending on the traffic. <br/><br/>Don’t worry about location, it was quite safe and pleasant. The inside of the apartment was wonderful, quite stylish and well appointed. It was super clean, especially for NYC. There was enough space for my family of 3 to spread out comfortably and enjoy our home base for a 10 night trip. Taran and Najla were great hosts and always answered any questions we had promptly and courteously; they even went out of their way to give us extra toiletries, cleaning products and trash bags since we had a longer stay. They also laundered our linens midway through our stay which we appreciated greatly. The restaurant menus they left in the house manual were a nice touch too. I have found the place I will be staying each time I come home to New York now. Thanks for a wonderful experience, Taran and Najla!"
2876,867610,2021-10-23,Very clean and just like the pictures we enjoyed our stay

2884,571758,2019-01-22,This was overall a great experience. The lockbox made it very easy to check in and out. We had all the privacy we could want. The space was very warm and had everything we needed. Space is only a few blocks away from the train station for easy commutes. There is also a pretty big shopping mall with restaurants very close to the area as well .
2885,441925,2021-06-27,"Pam had exhibited excellent communication skills to help meet my needs throughout the duration of my stay of the two month period. I was provided convenient access to the kitchen, its utensils, and bathroom facility. Five minute walk from the subway station, nearby local restaurants, and grocery stores. A strategic area that is truly recommended for individuals on travel contracts or if you are simply visiting significant landmarks/tourist spots of New York."
2886,175346,2019-09-30,Great place for a great price

The only little downside is the neighborhood is a little sketchy at night but I would definitely stay again. Thank you Dwain for your hospitality!"
2895,678345,2019-11-22,"Chiara is a lovely host and so rapid to respond to questions. The apartment looks EXACTLY like the photos, such a lovely vibe and space to come back too against the bustle of the city. <br/><br/>The noise from above wasn’t as bad as mentioned on other reviews, and we are very light sleepers! The floor is very thin and it’s a little annoying, but wasn’t a problem during our stay. <br/><br/>The apartment is located in Bushwick - which is basically 30 mins away from anything. With soaring prices/gentrification in other parts of Brooklyn, it’s quite clear that Bushwick is on the come up. With a 10 min walk to the nearest metro- if you’re happy to take a short stroll at the start of the day, it shouldn’t put you off. Would defo stay again!"
2896,678795,2019-03-30,"Lugar muy bien ubicado, tranquilo. Cerca de dos estaciones de subtes. Comunicación en español. Gran anfitrión."

2900,411020,2019-05-06,"Great space. Very well thought out amenities and touches - we had everything we needed for a comfortable stay. Nice to have the hosts nearby and personal interaction with them on arrival. Safe, cosy and well located - would definitely recommend."

2905,139955,2019-10-23,"El departamentode Jochy, esta chico pero tiene todo acomodado de tal manera que no te hará falta nada. Buen alojamiento aunque un poco lejos pero tiene estaciones de metro cerca para moverte por todo Manhattan."
2906,299935,2019-08-12,"Angie is a great host, she is really helpful and gives great tips how to get around New York. Her apartment is very nicely decorated and very spacious. The subway is only a short walk away and you can go downtown in 30-40 mins."
2907,424058,2021-10-16,Hands down the best Airbnb hosts I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. Down to earth and very attentive. Would wake up to coffee and had all our needs addressed. The place is shared but we never felt like our space was imposed upon. Love ya Aracelis and Calvin!
2908,217078,2021-05-23,"Delivered as advertised! Great place, great location and Margrethe was great to deal with. Thanks."
2909,169931,2019-06-28,safe neighborhood and thoughtful home design. Hosts are friendly. Dog is super cute and quiet.
2910,283852,2019-11-17,Alloggio accogliente dotato di ogni comfort. Ottima posizione a pochi minuti dalla fermata della metropolitana. Quartiere tranquillo con ogni servizio/attività necessaria. Consigliato. +++
2911,807385,2021-08-30,"Didn't have a great experience here. <br/><br/>Pros:  Close to the station, lock on bedroom door and very effective A/C in the room.  Big bed and a desk in room.  The co-host Owl was easy to contact, friendly and let me into the building when I checked in.<br/><br/>Cons:  Unfortunately I had quite a few.<br/>- Communication: Micheal was out of town during/before my stay - good for him not so good for me.  My questions before arrival went unanswered for multiple days.  While traveling there I was worried I wouldn't be able to access the Airbnb as I had no check in details in advance.  Michael finally contacted me on the app right at the time of check in but then stopped replying again after he gave me Owl's details.  <br/>- Upstairs neighbour plays drums and woke me up a few mornings around 7am.<br/>- Shower wasn't working well - wouldn't switch between the tub tap and the shower head. <br/>- Room was cleaned well before I arrived - floors were dirty, kept finding clumps of other peoples hair on my socks after walking around, stepped on someone else's nail clipping... <br/>- Bathroom had no lock on door (with another separate AirBnB booking in the apartment this was a bit sketchy)<br/>- Bathroom wasn't clean - someones hair on sink and bathtub.<br/>- Had to buy my own toilet paper <br/>- Trash in the bathroom and kitchen were both full to overflowing (bringing flies). <br/><br/>From other reviews it seems like when Michael is in town he does a better job of these things.  He was lovely on the phone when we did speak after the lock on the front door broke.  Maybe figure out if he will be in town before deciding to stay here."
2912,854836,2021-07-26,"Nice, cozy and very secure place to stay.  Very clean with and up to date kitchen and central air that you can control. You also have 1 1/2 baths which is also nice. It's a basement apartment so you can hear upstairs noise but it was minimal not overwhelming.  It's in a nice neighborhood and fairly close to the subway.  I would recommend  this listing and I enjoyed my stay."
2913,674075,2019-10-23,Très belle maison dans Brooklyn. Très calme mais avec quelques commerces à proximité. Et surtout en 35 minutes au coeur de Manhattan.
2914,501331,2020-11-16,This places was amazing! The other people who live there were super friendly. As soon as I got there I was greeted & given some pizza lol. The room was so much bigger then I thought it was gonna be. The photos need to be updated tho because it definitely looks different then the pictures seeing as there’s a stripper pole in the room as well. I had a great time  !

2921,683560,2019-05-30,"This apartment is stunning. It's truly beautiful, with every attention to design and comfort.

Eles têm três animais adoráveis (dois gatos e uma cadela), e a casa é bem limpa e confortável. O bairro também é tranquilo e seguro. <br/><br/>Durante nossa estadia, tivemos a oportunidade de conversar com nosso anfitrião. Ele nos ofereceu tequila e conversamos sobre como é viver em Nova Iorque. Essa troca de experiências, para mim, torna a viagem muito mais interessante."

Fun location, really close to some great cafes and restaurants. Subway station also very close by. Our communications with Erika were great. She was very responsive, kind and welcoming. Would love to stay here again."
2942,744426,2020-08-03,"Maria’s apt was perfect. If you’re looking to explore the city and stay in a great apartment, this is for you. Close to Central Park and so many great restaurants. Very clean and easy to check in!"

2947,68877,2019-11-16,"Great location - 2 subway stations nearby (L and M lines), take about 30 minutes to get into down town! Wonderful hosts! Clean and cozy room! Thanks!"
2948,608430,2021-10-05,"Nice location, clean, this room has access to the backyard which is nice! No tv so bring a laptop or something lol"
2949,852996,2021-09-09,"Clean home and comfy bed, great place to crash for a couple of days!"
2950,715892,2019-12-03,"Beautiful spacious and comfortable accommodation with all the facilities you would want such as towels, shower products, hairdryer, fresh drinking water, fridge and microwave. I didn’t explore much of the neighbourhood other than to walk to the different local subway stations which were about 10 minutes away. It generally took us 30-45minutes to get into Manhattan each day depending on where we were going."
2951,864898,2021-10-13,"We had a very lovely stay in this newly renovated apartment in the center of Brooklyn.  We were there to visit our son who lives nearby.  There are many places to eat and shop nearby, and the neighborhood is diverse and rich in culture.  When we visit NYC, we are usually out and about.  This was one of the few times we actually just stayed in for a few hours to relax, read and nap.<br/><br/>The apartment is beautiful, and very spacious.  It has high end furnishings, air conditioners that fully cover the entire apartment, nice large kitchen, and it was surprisingly well lit.  <br/><br/>Mickael was a gracious host.  He was very communicative and accommodating.  He checked in on us multiple times to be sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed.  When we asked questions, he was very quick to respond and was always helpful.  We appreciated his hospitality during our entire visit!<br/><br/>We would definitely come back.  It was nice to stay in a neighborhood, with a young family.  We felt safe and comfortable.  Thank you Mickael!"
2952,103477,2019-09-04,"Fantastic large room the vibrant and cultural neighbourhood of Nostrand, Bed-Stuy. The space is large and clean with mosquito nets for a reason. There’s a good air con in the room so if you can, don’t open the window in the summer. The kitchen and the bathroom are on the same floor with easy access and super clean and accessible. Yoki is super professional, nice, honest, kind and so flexible (within reason). We loved staying there with her and her family (who you will not see much of, I didn’t even realise there were so many people living there until we were due to leave). Shows how quiet and discreet everyone is there.  Loved the brownstones and the street still has locals ans isn’t covered in gentrification. You have food options a plenty and if worst comes to worse, there’s always dollar pizza. It’s also right next to the A&C Nostrand train station, 2min walk which was so helpful as we spent a lot of time on it. Will be coming again when we come Bach next year."
2953,672128,2021-09-26,Great space and rate. Thoughtful details. Nice responsive host.

2956,827303,2020-10-21,"Adorable spot, quick communication, great espresso/cappuccino spot around the corner as well as a little market for snacks. Close to the D & N trains. Would love to stay again!"

2961,781003,2021-09-12,"Jess was a great host -- I highly recommend this apartment! Jess made it easy for us to find the location and get in without issue. The place was clean and Jess made it feel like a home away from home. The apartment is very spacious, especially with the private patio out back. Easy subway access or simply wander out the front door for so much that Williamsburg has to do. We hope to stay again soon!"
2962,818776,2021-09-26,"I loved staying at this Airbnb. It is in a great location, on a quiet street. You have privacy and it’s incredibly clean and has everything one would need while away from home. It’s perfect for a short or long term stay. Benjamin was very helpful and accommodating and always quick to reply to any message."
2963,658886,2019-08-17,Bill and Lori were wonderful hosts and very helpful in making our trip memorable.  It was the best of both a beach trip and a city experience that we could hope for.
2964,50825,2019-12-31,"Lovely and very clean apartment with a peaceful vibe. Felt like I was staying with a friend with all the plants and sweet Monkey as my companion. Bed was super comfortable and the bedroom was nice and dark. Shower was awesome!  Apartment was unusually quiet by NY standards and in a great, convenient location. Check in was a breeze, which is always appreciated after a long journey. Jasmine is quick to reply and offered many great suggestions about the area restaurants, venues, etc. Would definitely recommend and stay here again."
2965,819511,2021-07-29,Great vibe and location.  Would definitely stay again.

The place was fully equipped with fast internet, towels, water and everything we needed! Check in was easy and Michael was a wonderful host! We will be back! Thank you again :)"
2968,538919,2019-07-30,The host canceled this reservation 9 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
2969,431964,2021-03-10,"Truly a spacious one bedroom with great light. Michelle was super responsive and communicative, which was much appreciated with my last minute trip. Door code in front made getting in easy. Everything worked, and Michelle even brought up a new can opener and tupperware for me! Location is great, in Bed Stuy on the border of Bushwick — good subway access and also a lot to do within a few minute walk."
2970,797981,2021-04-25,First time in NYC and this place was amazing! Would book again! Corey made sure to have all small and thoughtful touches throughout the place!
2971,294801,2019-05-11,Logement très propre proche du métro et des commerçants dans un quartier sympa et animé. Je le recommande vivement.
2972,210506,2019-06-26,"Our stay at Joshua's and Daniel's place was very nice and uncomplicated. The place was very clean and tidy. They gave us some tips about nice restaurants in the area. The subway is pretty close and there is a supermarket just around the corner.<br/>The weather was really warm during our stay so the place got pretty warm since it's on the last floor, but they have an AC and a fan which helped a lot. And Rosi, their dog, is super friendly and enjoys company :) <br/><br/>Maybe the couch is a bit too narrow for two but we found a way of sleeping well on it so therefore it wasn't an issue."
2973,266152,2019-11-24,Wonderful spot for our quick trip in a great location!
2974,141078,2021-09-05,Rhonda’s place was clean with plenty of space and amenities. The location was also great with lots of restaurants nearby. It was relatively easy to find parking in the area. Rhonda herself was very friendly and helpful! We enjoyed our stay there and would definitely stay again!
2975,444829,2020-03-14,"Friendly, good and clear communication, clean and low cost."
2976,279040,2019-06-12,"Andres and Salina are incredible hosts, they were so flexible and helpful with everything our entire stay.  The room is the perfect size and the balcony is amazing way to unwind after a long day.  The location is perfect for people wanting to explore the best parts of Queens, with South Asian, Colombian and Central American bars and restaurants all in the neighborhood as well as being down the road or a quick subway trip to Flushing to see the Mets or go to Koreatown.  Really genuinely great people and would definitely recommend anyone visiting NY to stay there."
2977,752450,2021-10-10,Enjoyed our stay
2978,704053,2019-06-07,Everything was nice and clean
2979,873057,2021-09-22,"Overall loved the space! Super cute, bright and open. Really the only complaint I have is the kitchen was poorly stocked…the main reason I needed a bnb over a hotel was to be able to cook, but it was missing a lot of essential cooking utensils so it was difficult. Otherwise exactly what I was looking for! "
2980,218144,2019-12-14,"Very nice place to stay on Staten Island and near the city! Clean, cozy and just steps from the bus stop. Great place to stay if you have a few days and are looking to stay out of the hustle of Manhattan."
2981,476313,2019-07-25,"Very clean and comfortable and a perfect space for staying for a few days, but if you don’t like basements and loud footsteps than look somewhere else"
2982,611868,2021-09-09,"Maritza's apartment in the heights is a great stay - easy access to the subway and Columbia's hospital complex, helpful amenities, and Maritza is very responsive. Special shoutout to her wonderful mother who helped us out when we couldn't quite figure out the key upon arrival."
2983,890444,2021-12-03,"Decent and cost effective place, gets the job done"

2987,681690,2019-12-23,Nice and clean room
2988,862063,2021-08-29,"Alvaro and Tim are the greatest hosts ever. They're super kind and attentive to grant that our stay was more than perfect. The kitchen is well equipped and in good condition. The room is super spacious, with a tv, AC, and a fridge to keep our groceries. The bathroom was clean and we have an independent cabinet to keep inside our stuff. <br/><br/>The apartment is really close to the subway (no more than 3 mins walk-distance) and close to restaurants and shops. The area is very well located and the surroundings are quiet and safe, we felt always secure to arrive even at nighttime. <br/><br/>We totally recommend this place, totally worth it!"
2989,124371,2021-04-23,Great place to stay.
2990,784601,2021-02-18,I paid and couldn’t stay because I was 19 years of age still currently waiting on a refund lol
2991,47074,2019-05-19,Todd had a ton of great local recommendations and the location was amazing!
2992,383864,2019-05-06,"My stay at Michelle's was way better than I expected. She was excellent at communicating, and responded very quickly to any questions we had. The check-in process was very simple- we actually got in much earlier than our check-in time and were going to have to wait for a few hours- luckily, the previous patrons planned to check out early, so she was able to accommodate our request.  It was very helpful to not have to wait around in a restaurant with our luggage for 4 hours :) That's what I call going above and beyond! <br/>Location-wise, the apartment is about a 10 minute walk to the train station, so the commute to the city was not bad at all. There are also a lot of local markets/ delis around, making it easy to go out and buy items for breakfast or lunch to cut down on eating out too much. <br/>Overall, I was very pleased with my experience and would definitely consider this apartment for future stays."
2993,787526,2021-10-15,Excelente!
2994,702742,2019-06-29,"My husband and I stayed at this apartment for our honeymoon. The space is well kept and easy access to the train stops. Easy and great communication with host. There is an AC Unit, but only in the bedroom, an additional unit would be nice. It was 90 degrees everyday when we were there, the AC Unit helped but it was still pretty warm in the apartment."
2995,840796,2021-04-07,Amazing view
2996,622009,2020-11-02,"Terrific home with beachfront access. Convenient to everything. Jackee was a terrific and accommodating host. Can't wait to get back again for our next trip, hoping to make it an annual getaway!"
2997,290798,2020-02-19,Sloan's space was perfect for me. Great location and very clean and bright. The bedroom is small but i prefer small functional spaces. The location couldn't be more perfect.
2998,777210,2020-02-05,Good room close to NYP.
2999,651764,2019-08-02,深夜の遅いﾌﾗｲﾄでしたが､快く受け入れてくださって助かりました。空港からはUberに乗って15分ぐらいほどで着きます。また､ﾁｪｯｸｲﾝはｾﾙﾌﾁｪｯｸｲﾝだったので楽でした。
3000,562223,2019-10-17,Very good apartment for a long stay in NYC. Exactly as pictured and clean. Many stores are nearby and the subway is very close.
3001,357640,2019-04-06,"Pete was a great host. He responded quickly to all of my messages and texts, and even suggested things to see based on what I mentioned we were doing in the area. He was thoughtful and kind. The apartment is extremely clean and always smelled good! Our bed was very comfortable, bathroom was spotless and we felt very relaxed and at ease in the space whether or not he was present. I highly recommend staying here, the location was amazing! Close to so many things downtown and we were only ~20 mins by subway from uptown and museum row. We would stay here again! Thanks Pete :)"

3007,252134,2021-10-19,Julie is rad and her apartment is a great spot to stay. Highly recommend!
3008,600684,2019-12-01,"Edna is a good lady, she baked banana bread, cornbread and served tea and coffee also cooked thanksgiving dinner and offered but I am a vegetarian so I could not eat, but she made cranberry sauce and offered me that. Only one thing that the private room, long-staying guests should not have to compromise for all of a sudden rule of the kitchen not being accessible after 10 PM for the sake of guest staying in the living room which is adjacent to kitchen, as if someone comes late due to some work or trains being delayed, which always happens in NY, should that person is expected not to heat/eat dinner? although Edna offered to use the microwave in her room,  I would not want to disturb her to use microwave inside her room, when there is already one in the kitchen beside the guest in living room are already aware that it is a sharing situation in the living room which is adjacent to kitchen so there shall be a little noise which is expected, that's  why the price of that space is less, so the long staying guests should not have to compromise for it.<br/>Also the rugs are a bit slippery, I escaped from slipping many times and is a hinderence to take the luggage in and out but Edna helped me with take my lugguage down and also with the car service."
3009,846856,2021-08-06,Perfect for a short stay. Was traveling for work and it was exactly what I needed. Parking situation was amazing.
3010,601507,2019-11-05,"Laura's place was immaculate! It was my first time in New York and I wanted to stay near my friend but I was visiting. Needless to say, that was kind of a mistake because I am disabled and apparently, not all of the stations have elevators. I chose this place because it had an elevator. For alone wheelchair users, it is not ideal for you. I digress. She had everything. There was even a little refrigerator with drinks and water bottles that saved my life. I wish I had booked something in the city itself, but for the price, it's really not that bad. I also wasn't expecting for ride sharing apps to be that expensive in New York. I even came back to her and her family cleaning the house. That is how clean this place has! Thank you so much, Laura, for having me. :)"
3011,629423,2020-01-31,"We really enjoyed our staying at this Apartment.  It was close to everything in ManHattan, walking distance to Grand Central, shops, food places, groceries, everything.

3016,687206,2021-09-27,"Beau grand appartement. L’idéal pour 3 personnes. Très beau, propre et calme. Un point négatif est le jet de douche qui est trop fort et coule comme une champlure"
3017,764243,2019-10-26,"Cute place extremely well located in New York. Jon is a great host - the apartment is immaculately maintained. The only caution is the street can get a bit noisy in the evening for us light sleepers.. but hey, this is New York : )"

3020,358527,2021-07-31,"I had a lovely 3 month stay at Jonathan's apartment. the building is very quiet, clean, and well kept. there is laundry in the basement it was very convenient. The kitchen was fully equipped with everything I needed and the living room is very nice to lounge in and read a book and drink coffee.  the bed was comfortable and the air conditioner was nice and cold. the water pressure in the shower was excellent. it is a close walk to the B or Q train to Manhattan and the building is so quiet, I loved that!!! Iwoulddefinitely recommend Jonathan's place. He  was very responsive to anything I may have needed."
3021,849299,2021-01-18,Yuan is a wonderful and gracious host. The room is very clean and Yuan makes sure her guests are comfortable with everything. She takes all the safety precautions with covid and makes sure everything in the apartment is safe to use. I would definitely stay again when I visit!
3022,711928,2019-12-19,"We had a long journey behind us and we can say that we found the apartment very easy. We felt very comfortable with everything that Anastasia had prepared. The apartment was clean, the kitchen had mostly anything that we needed and the bedrooms were comfortable too. The connection to Manhattan with public transportation was perfect and  right in front of the apartment is a delicious Italian restaurant. Anastasia left for anyone of us Metro cards. That's definitly a big plus. We enjoyed our stay at the most!"

3029,838893,2021-06-21,"We were super pleased with our stay.  The hotel was very clean, and we loved the modern simplicity of the room.  The beds were ridiculously comfortable- we slept so well!  We had a great view of the East River. And the location was simply the best!  We were right next to Pier 17.  Everything we could’ve wanted was within a few blocks.  We road Citi Bikes on the dedicated bike trail to Chelsea Market and other parts of the city.  It was the best stay we’ve had in NYC in years, thanks to the location!  <br/><br/>Also, staff was so responsive and friendly - living on the cake!"
3030,473989,2021-11-12,"Izabel's Airbnb is a lovely refuge from the noise and bustle of the city. It is quiet, clean, safe and has a Zen-like atmosphere. It is also in a fine location with a short walk to the extensive and delightful Prospect Park (great for runners, cyclists, strollers, or picnickers.) Coffee shops, food markets, restaurants, subways, etc. are all within a short walk. Do be careful to follow directions carefully when unlocking and locking the front door. If you want a wash cloth or extra towels you may need to bring your own.  Overall, if you want an affordable and restful place to stay, Izabel's may be the perfect place for you."
3031,755281,2020-09-01,Very clean space! Would definitely recommend
3032,656463,2019-03-31,"We had a great stay. Apartment was everything we had hoped for: clean, spacious, good connection to city, cosy, etc. JoAnn was very welcoming and always easy to reach and very responsive. Would definitely stay here again and also recommend to friends."

3034,847735,2021-07-24,"100% a great place to live for a couple of days! Describes exactly how it is - definitely a great place to just sleep at and be out for most of the day. Its a very convenient spot and it was practically spotless when we came in! Definitely fits only up to four people, but it works out! Would come back!"
3035,769387,2020-01-01,"It's a nice place and clean, the host was good in communicating with the us. I would visit again!"
3036,124662,2019-10-17,Really nice and big apartment for a fair price. Totally recommended!

3039,811084,2021-08-29,"Had a pleasant stay at this air bnb location.<br/>Pros:<br/>-very comfortable bed<br/>-private room<br/>-location is near the subway/metro<br/>-room has desk/chair<br/>-nice building<br/>Cons:<br/>-check in time is a bit late (7pm. but this was stated since the beginning.)<br/>-at the end of the stay, you have to return the keys to the 711(keycafe box) which is a bit cumbersome instead of turning them back in to the host or leaving them in the apartment.<br/>-there's another room in the apartment also being rented.<br/>Overall it was nice. Javier always made himself available for any inquiries/concerns."
3040,701502,2019-12-15,"This studio was perfect for our stay. We had no issues finding the place  and the check in procedure was super easy thanks to the step by step guide provided by Cherry! The bottles of water and snacks provided at the entrance were a great touch and the room/bathroom was a good size and very clean. The room was a bit chilly upon entry as some other reviewers noted, but the heater provided in the room warmed up the space to a comfortable temp very quickly. We only needed a place to sleep/shower  at night and spent the day sightseeing around Manhattan, so this was perfect for that purpose. There was some very nice cafes within walking distance (10min walk) that we pleasantly found. We would definitely stay here for the weekend again!"
3041,724649,2021-06-16,We came back to Say's for one more night after a trip upstate for a few days. Fortunately the apartment was available and it made the trip to La Guardia Airport on our departure date less rushed. Another great thing about the location is how close it is to LGA--it took about 15 minutes to get there in the late morning on a weekday. LGA has been tremendously improved over the last few years and it's a great alternative to JFK.
3042,560402,2021-01-09,Cosy place!
3043,891190,2021-11-28,This funky hotel on a street-art-infused alley is in a wonderful location and very clean. A great place to stay!
3044,443086,2019-12-31,Small but cozy space! Barely saw anyone else that lives there so it felt like it was very private. Getting luggage up the stairs is difficult without help. Location is awesome and I recommend!
3045,712559,2021-02-24,"Cozy space in great location, good hosts!"
3046,840385,2021-08-04,"I live in nyc and decided to stay in a hotel for a few days because my boyfriend and I had a fight. I chose the AC Hotel because it was by the water and I hoped it would be relaxing and help me calm down. When I checked in, Randy was the front desk agent, and he was just awesome. He asked what brought me in and when I told him, he misheard me, and it was so funny that we had a laugh which immediately disarmed me. He then offered me a room on the highest floor, and I nearly broke into tears (but I didn't because I'm a New Yorker). The room was lovely, clean and had everything I needed. The rest of the staff was helpful, and The location is great. I won't stay anywhere else whenever I need to get away again!"
3047,569071,2021-07-29,"Highly recommended!!<br/><br/>Mike was extremely responsive, helpful and accommodating with any need - big and small!<br/><br/>The apartment offers a great value - it is very comfortable, spacious (especially in NY standards) and has all that's needed for a pleasant stay and much more, including a fully equipped kitchen, very large TV set with access to all the main show channels.<br/><br/>The bedroom is very comfortable with a very comfortable queen size bed.  It keeps a nice cool temperature even during the hottest summer days (it has its own A/C in case needed but I never needed to use it during my summer stay).<br/><br/>The neighborhood is absolutely lovely with numerous excellent cafes, restaurants and stores within a very short walk. There are 3 subway stations within 10 minutes walk from the apartment, and it takes 20-30 minutes subway ride to get to most attractions in Manhattan.<br/><br/>Enjoy your stay!"
3048,773243,2019-12-02,I highly recommend this place for everyone who wants to have a great experience in New York. *****<br/>There are 4 or 5 different subways lines near the house and your distance to Manhattan is only four stations. Also the neighbourhood has a lot of different restaurants and grocery. You will be well served with that. The place is really fresh new and the home appliances are new and modern. We had all attention we needed from the hosts and the check-in and check-out was so easy. Absolutely I will will stay at this place again when I come back to New York City.
3049,100997,2020-07-09,"Beautiful place, one of the best hosts I’ve had with Airbnb. Thanks again"
3050,584709,2020-03-14,"Place was especially clean and spacious, especially considering it’s in nyc. Host was communicative throughout and the check in process was easy."
3051,668647,2019-04-17,"It was our first visit to NYC as tourists and we couldn't have been more pleased.  The location was great--just two blocks from Central Park, close to several subway stations, and a short walk to Rockefeller Plaza and Times Square.  The room was very comfortable and the breakfast and dinner each day was a bonus."
3052,856330,2021-07-18,This was the perfect place for a quick night away. We enjoyed our stay and the amenities were perfect. We chose this airbnb for quality and location and we were not disappointed!
3053,754343,2021-04-25,"Great stay, felt very comfortable. I would go back again!"
3054,845327,2021-01-17,Amazing stay and an amazing host
3055,622393,2020-01-26,"This was our first experience with airbnb and it was all positive!  We are ""senior citizens"" but young in spirit and decided to try what our kids have enjoyed with their travels.  Artem's  accommodations were everything as presented  and we were pleased with everything.  Great location to the subway, food, and dining.  She helped us find what we were looking for and promptly answered any questions.  We wouldn't hesitate to recommend Artem as a host, everything we hoped more and more!"
3056,734645,2021-07-25,If you’re looking for a cozy comfortable place to stay this is the spot - it’s kind of far out in Brooklyn in a two fare zone so you need to Uber/Lyft into other parts of Brooklyn or Manhattan
3057,214382,2019-11-30,"I was a little uneasy doing a month Airbnb rental in NYC, but the hosts and room were far better than expected. Communication was superb, with immediate responses from the hosts. Any time I needed anything or had questions the hosts were able to answer them right away. The space was very clean, and very quiet. I was able to work remotely from the room without any issues with WiFi connection at all. I would definitely recommend this Airbnb!!!"
3058,811995,2021-08-04,"The bed slid me to the middle a bit, but otherwise the room was clean and accurately described. The restroom facilities were all amazingly clean for common shared space. Absolutely fabulous location, great to hit farmers market at Union Square and we loved Venchi chocolates."
3059,702534,2019-04-23,"Place is in a great location, right across the street from the beach.  Incredible beach views from the master.  Kitchen is well appointed.  It is very easy to get to Manhattan, by ferry or train.   Good restaurants and coffee shops within walking distance.  The beach is the main attraction.   The bathroom is small but keeps it authentic to a beach bungalow.  There is no TV so bring your electronics.  Very bohemian/bungalow feel.  Samantha is responsive and kind.  Enjoy!"
3060,259676,2020-01-05,"I absolutely loved staying here! I was so sad to leave when my work was finished in nyc. <br/><br/>Location is one of the best things about this place! And the square footage was perfect and very comfortable for me.<br/><br/>I hadn’t realized it was on the 5th floor with no elevator, that was the only difficult part of staying there, but my legs got strong and the location and size of the apartment were enough to want to come back someday.<br/><br/>Juliana was also such an incredible host! When I needed assistance, she was there and took care of everything in a very timely manner. <br/><br/>I can’t recommend this apartment more! I wish I lived here!"
3061,874548,2021-09-27,This accommodation was absolutely amazing . Ace was very accommodating with a special request I had where as he allowed my luggage to be dropped off early before check in . This was monumental as I was exhausted from flying all night on a red eye . Lugging a suit case around NYC was not something I wanted to do . The place A+++ from the attention to detail right down to Aces genuine hospitality . I will definitely rebook this choice . Location right in the heart of everything !
3062,791567,2020-01-03,"Perfect place, close to line 6 that gets you to Downtown and Uptown at Astor Place. Good restaurants at the same street."
3063,661980,2019-03-16,"Nice space for the price, bigger than in pictures, super safe around and really close to the subway"
3064,641375,2021-05-03,"Place was pretty much perfect, couldn’t have asked for a better deal. Cleanliness was definitely a 10/10, communication was on point , location is 4 blocks from the Subway which will make it easy to move in and around town for sure. Definitely the NY experience- totally recommend this place to other people"
3065,635043,2020-01-13,"Disfrutamos mucho de nuestra estancia en NYC y en especial en el apartamento. Carles fue muy amable y siempre respondía oportunamente a cualquier pregunta que tuviéramos. La ubicación es excelente, solo unos 30 minutos para llegar a Manhattan. El vecindario es seguro. El check-in fue fácil y el apartamento cuenta con todas las comodidades. No dudaría en recomendarlo altamente y definitivamente volveríamos a hospedarnos nuevamente en su lugar. Gracias, Carles y Hans."
3066,397598,2021-11-10,"Chantelle’s place is really clean, functional, and conveniently located for a great stay in NYC. She is easy to communicate with, and check in was really straight forward. We had a great stay!"
3067,94074,2021-03-13,"John was a great host! I highly recommend staying at his place. The space is spotlessly clean, the bed was very comfortable with just enough natural light. He has a desk in there to do work, it was perfect for me while I was WFH. The only thing I would note is that it is a 6th floor walk-up, which I didn't mind and the stay was worth it! John opened up his home to me and allowed me to use the kitchen, cook if I wanted to, and even had some coffee leftover that I could brew. He responds very promptly, answers any questions, is patient, kind, and friendly. He was happy to engage in conversation while also providing me space. I had no complaints, and actually would have liked to extend my stay if possible. Highly recommend!!"
3068,771330,2019-12-22,"Beautiful apartment, located in a quiet neighborhood, in front of Central Park !!!  Very comfortable, cozy and stylish.  Services such as restaurants and supermarkets nearby, metro and bus stations accessible.  The best: the attention and warmth of the hostess.  Highly recommended."
3069,679662,2019-04-19,"If you’re looking for a great place to stay in Brooklyn that is convenient, clean and comfortable - start here. Its perfect for a small family and the host is really accommodating."
3070,514588,2019-10-19,Great host!
3071,743712,2019-09-02,Great apartment right next to the beach.  We really enjoyed our stay and hope to return. Thanks for having us!
3072,793125,2021-01-18,Nothing much
3073,748283,2021-11-20,"Great location, really problematic place - requires a lot of owner's attention (currently the window is dangerous, reported to owner and Airbnb support). <br/>The heating system is really noisy and gets turned at night (12 AM and 5 AM) for 1hr and makes sauna from the room.<br/><br/>The room is smaller than you can expect from the photos,  recommend for 1 traveler only. The bathroom displayed on pictures is designed for other rooms, for this room is designed other bathroom, smaller and in worse condition."
3074,851361,2021-04-12,Great location. The hotel also has a rooftop patio which added an extra touch that was nice.
3075,580093,2020-01-15,"Great location, spacious, everything you need for a wonderful time in Brooklyn. The space felt bigger than I expected from the photos. It is as described...maybe even better! The design is incredible - beautiful and efficient.   The bed is very comfortable and it was very quiet all night so we were able to sleep peacefully.<br/><br/>Right next door is an excellent cafe for breakfast and lunch - walk a few more blocks to even more places to eat.<br/><br/>Megan communicated quickly and easily to my pre-booking questions.  She has created a beautiful, cozy place - thank you so much!  I hope to come back and spend more time."
3076,655514,2019-04-03,"This place is very nice, it's so clean (the room,the kitchen,the bathroom) , the area is Safe, its near the Subway 6(1 street above) , they responded to our questions very fast ... Thanks Ociel and Karla."
3077,767012,2021-06-09,"Great place in a genuine New York neighborhood, Hell's Kitchen. Perfect spot for two people or two couples, ideal location, and minutes from great food (Turkish Cuisine on 9th Ave has great sangria and grape leaves, Empanada Mama is delicious), drinks (Beer Cheese for craft brews, Bird and Branch for coffee), and subway stations. Heads up: the hookah bar below the apartment goes late and loud some nights. Keep the AC on and you'll sleep through it."
3078,733309,2021-01-01,The place was so close to the airport. It was New Years Eve so the neighbors were playing music really loud. The second bed is a box spring with a one inch layer of foam on it. The host is super responsive to any request and even said Happy New Year. Netflix was set on the TV. The internet was slow.
3079,806233,2021-10-23,"Очень грязная комната. На кухне не было приборов, чашек, глубоких тарелок.<br/>В холле постоянный запах.<br/><br/>Сильная слышимость - слышно всех соседей.<br/><br/>Район неплохой, до метро можно дойти пешком, но достаточно далеко.<br/>Недалеко есть неплохой продуктовый магазин.<br/><br/>Остановились здесь из-за близости к жилью друзей, если бы не эта необходимость, то выбрали бы другое место."

3085,585525,2019-12-16,"I loved staying at Anna’s!! It was such a quaint, lovely home base while I was visiting NYC. the bed was so comfortable, it soaked me in like a cloud, and she had amazing little touches like a candle in the kitchen, coffee beans, amazingly scented shampoo, conditioner, and body wash; easy to get in and out, perfect kitchen. I can’t wait to come back and stay again soon!!"

3089,806570,2020-03-11,The host canceled this reservation the day before arrival. This is an automated posting.
3090,72509,2019-12-08,"This is a cozy hideaway in a trendy brownstone with up to date features in a clean, and quiet area near Smith St.  Your hosts are friendly and have plenty of great recommendations to share with you about where to eat, drink and shop. Loved it!"
3091,714209,2019-12-12,this place is a great value. the bed is super comfortable. the room (extra cozy) and the shared bathroom are super clean. great communication from the host. literally a minute's walk from the 7 train. i strongly recommend sonia's place.
3092,387018,2019-09-15,"Ephraim's apartment is exactly as cosy and clean as it is in the pictures. We had a great time in NYC and we enjoyed it very much to call his place our ""home"" for two weeks. Ephraim is a perfect host. Everything worked smoothly and when we had a request he was super quick to meet it. Be aware that it is a 20-30 minutes' subway ride the standard New York sights (we didn't mind). I can only recommend this place emphatically."
3093,820862,2021-05-26,Great Stay ...Great Communication Definitely Recommend
3094,873282,2021-10-17,"Lovely apartment in a great location. Quiet. Comfortable bed. Spacious, attractive rooms. It's the middle of Chinatown and right on the border of Little Italy. The park across the street is a delight. We didn't get to meet Liza, but we look forward to it. We hope to return to this excellent place."
3095,564536,2019-11-02,A lovely cosy studio apartment in a fantastic location. Chelsea was very helpful and gave us loads of info and tips before we arrived and was quick to communicate and answer any questions. Thanks for a great stay!
3096,390424,2020-01-03,The place is great just like we expected. We lived in three different places during the vacation. This is the only place which gave us a feeling of home. Everything you need is in the apartment. The communication between us and the host is also excellent
3097,348118,2019-08-16,Really clean and cute and the beds are so comfortable! Also the subway is only a block or so away.

3101,601130,2021-09-03,"There is nothing negative to say!  Stephanie is an amazing hostess and her place is adorable!  Extremely clean, extremely comfortable and way bigger than the hotels I have stayed in in NYC.  Stephanie answered texts promptly and is so very nice!  My husband and I stayed for 2 nights and were disappointed when we had to move to a hotel for our last (Website hidden by Airbnb) fault for procrastinsting on booking!  And the best part...a neighbor cat came to visit on our last morning there!  (Cat lover here, so  it was great!)  So thankful for Stephanie and her hospitality.  Made our trip that much better!  Lots of food places near by, subway near by, taxis were hard to get but Lyfts/Ubers were there in a heartbeat!"

3106,797797,2021-11-11,"Really enjoyed this location. Esther was very accommodating. The apartment was clean and stocked with all that you’d expect. The AC did the trick for a surprisingly warm Fall weekend in Manhattan, but it might get stuffy deep summertime."
3107,596031,2019-05-08,Not far from the train and easy to find.

3110,415704,2019-06-29,Sidney is very friendly and knowledgeable about the area. Flatbush is a great place to stay As well. It is not as hectic as other parts of Brooklyn and is close to everything. We were able to get to both Coney Island and the Brooklyn Museum with ease.
3111,722816,2021-08-15,Tom and Reina are great hosts and I thank them for allowing us in their home. I enjoyed their Time book collection of decades/eras during our stay. They respond quickly to messages.  It is exactly as it is described in other comments so nothing surprising.  The location is quaint and safe. If you drive here be sure to read up on traffic and parking laws.  I got a ticket for parking on wrong side of street for road cleaning between 8 and 10 am on a Friday ‍♀️

3118,743754,2020-03-08,"Jose has a great place with a lot of style. He was very kind always, even months before arriving to NY he answer all of our questions with courtesy. The place is very safe and everything is at your disposal to use, the safety lock and welcome instructions make it very easy to feel comfortable and at home."
3119,625961,2019-08-20,"Thank you to Shen son, Joe, and his mother. Great place. Location at 50 meters from Metro station line 6 that takes you anywhere from Bronx to Brooklyn Bridge and back, five stations far from Central and Times Square. Two Blocks from Central Park Walking distance to the Met and Guggenheim."

3124,668062,2019-08-23,Great location in the center of Astoria. The room is clean and comfortable. Tim’s got eclectic taste and the apartment is tidy and uncluttered. Rules are made clear and strictly enforced. Room gets nice light and the bathroom is clean and airy. I would suggest providing a hand/face towel. AC works well and keeps the room cool. The subway goes through frequently and can be heard from the room.  Overall a pleasant stay in a fantastic neighborhood.
3125,772318,2019-11-06,Awesome at Pings
3126,495208,2020-02-15,I had a great stay. Very nice and everyone from Property Management was helpful and quick to respond.
3127,632553,2021-09-30,"Pretty solid Airbnb! if you are in NYC to explore the city and you don’t plan to be in the room for long with the exception of sleeping at night then I believe, for the money, this Airbnb would be a pretty good choice.<br/><br/>Disclaimer !!!: This Airbnb lacks hot water for the shower, however, by no means is the water to cold that it’s unbearable."
3128,871764,2021-07-22,This place is a gem. We stayed for 4 nights and the apartment is cozy and quiet. The perfect size for 2 to visit. The kitchen is nice ams has everything we needed. Internet was great. I highly recommend staying here!  Patricia was so sweet and helpful!
3129,484274,2019-03-14,"We thought, we could not be more amazed than what we expected from the photos of the apartment - how much we were wrong. Jeff is the best host which you can imagine. Trust me, there is no better. He will take care of you as good as your own mother and help you even with the smallest things. Neighbourhood might feel unsafe for the first time, but even when I came back at midnight, there was no problem at all and you can see how quiet it is. Close to metro and a few really good restaurants nearby."
3130,512474,2019-10-10,"Louie's place was awesome!  Great location near Chelsea, Hudson Yards, and the High Line, and Louie and his co-host were very friendly and helpful."
3131,884723,2021-10-04,"Wow! Wow! what can I say about this place. This place was off the chain. It was clean, cute, cozy, decorative, homey and comfortable. The owner is very creative. Shower was large  i enjoyed bathing in it. I also like the outside private balcony. I would do this again."
3132,315946,2019-12-01,"The apartment is clean and beautiful. The bed is in the living room and sectioned off with curtains. Inside that space, there is a bedside lamp, a fan, a small heater and plenty of outlets so you'll have everything you need. <br/>Washington Heights is a lively neighbourhood and the apartment is about a five minutes walk from the 1 train. I took the walk at around 2 am and I felt pretty safe. (I don't know if that was actually wise, but I never felt scared or unsafe.) <br/>You need to ask for Check-in instructions and the apartment number. It is on the fifth floor so be mindful of that if you have trouble with stairs. Also, keep in mind that if there are other guests coming on the day you will not be allowed to leave any bags in the apartment after the check-out time. (I had a backpack but I couldn't leave it there from 12-2). That might be an important consideration if you have a flight or bus late in the day/night and don't want to carry your stuff with you. <br/>I never met Cynthia, but her mother and sister were very nice. She answers messages after a few hours up to the next day so ask ahead or call if you really need something. Overall, I found the place and the experience pretty accurate to the descriptions. It's great if you only want a base to sleep at night and are planning to explore the city for most of your time."
3133,697259,2019-01-13,Very comfortable and quiet I enjoyed my stay .
3134,2910,2019-08-10,Edward was a great host.  Very responsive and clear with communication.  Also was accommodating despite unexpected changes in my flight.  Good location to explore NYC.
3135,371555,2021-08-07,"Inna’s place was a perfect place for my stay in the city during the summer. The studio has everything you will need, is very centric and very secure. The only thing that can be better is the host communication, because I got some issues during my check in and she responded like 2-3 hours later.<br/><br/>Besides that, 100% recommended, you will love it."
3136,786308,2020-08-23,Wonderful host
3137,657916,2019-10-14,"amazing host. great area, great amenities, timely responses. 10/10"
3138,823248,2020-11-27,"3 of us, spent thanksgiving this year here. <br/><br/>We thought it was a truly beautiful home, <br/><br/>I loved everything, <br/><br/>we felt very comfortable and it’s perfect amount of space to be relaxed. <br/><br/>Great for about 2-4 people. <br/><br/>Perfect for couples."
3139,22162,2020-01-19,"This place is more of a room in a brownstone / townhouse than a whole apartment to one's self. If that doesn't bother you too much, then it'll be dope."
3140,417213,2019-09-06,Sid was very accommodating and thorough with his overview of the space and its goings-on. The room was perfect to rest up before a day of travel. I'd definitely come again. A very pleasant experience!
3141,340777,2019-01-11,Super cozy space in the perfect location. The whole loft itself made for a great North Brooklyn experience and I’m glad I stayed here. Would recommend.
3142,702481,2019-10-19,"Parfaitement placé pour nos besoins, appartement spacieux et confortable, hôte cordial et attentif."

3144,890053,2021-11-04,"Upon arrival the sheets were noticeably dirty (despite a cleaning fee), and there was a cigarette hole in the pillow. Dirty in general too! <br/><br/>When I messaged the host, no apology was given - only suggested sending a family member to ‘look’."
3145,782554,2019-11-03,"Perfect location (and price for location!), perfect room and most importantly perfect hosts! The room is very neat and clean and spacious with a comfortable bed, very conveniently located next to main attractions in NY such as Times Square (5 mins walk), Minskoff Theatre (next to times square) for the Lion King, or the Intrepid (11 minutes walk). Nathalia was also very sweet and quick to answer, provided instantly a heater when she was texted that it felt a bit cold. You simply CANNOT get a better deal in NY, thank you!"
3146,386845,2019-08-19,"This is a nice clean location in a cool neighborhood. It was easy to get to grocery stores, decent eateries and the subway. <br/><br/>Ephraim offered a great list of tips that made it feel like home for the short time we were in the city.<br/><br/>We would definitely stay here again. Much better than a hotel in my opinion."
3147,146615,2021-04-05,"A super sweet couple, they were very understanding when we were late and very accommodating. It was close to a bunch of different sights around New York. 11/10 <br/>You would be crazy not to stay here!"
3148,757058,2020-09-20,Good place to stay
3149,544382,2020-01-21,"Amazing stay in Brooklyn, NY. If you are looking for clean private room in apartment for great value that is close to subway & supermarket, you are definitely in the right place. Rahul is defined as superhost for good reason. He responded to all of our question/requirements in few minutes and described all details before check-in. Definitely 5/5!"
3150,569025,2020-01-07,"Wonderful apartment in a fantastic area. We stayed for almost 3 weeks. While in NY we took the Subway a lot, very convenient from this accommodation. Highly recommend!"
3151,850761,2021-09-24,Great place! Wonderful for repeat visits.
3152,378192,2019-02-28,"The room was nice and simple. A bed, a night table and tea set-up but the best part was a tv with real cable. Not really a fan of Amazon Stick or Roku. I feel having access to local channels lets you know more about a place than Hulu/Netflix access will. The location was within walking distance to two major subway lines the A and #1. If you want a clean and convenient place to explore NYC look no further than this property. Please note: There is only a twin bed in the room so this property is better suited for a solo traveler."
3153,803214,2020-03-10,"The apartment was tastefully decored and luxurious. Emma was a considerate host, she went above and beyond to accommodate all my travel needs and ensure I had a great stay. 100% would stay again when I visit NYC in the future."
3154,390413,2020-03-19,The host canceled this reservation 32 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
3155,709757,2019-06-10,"Nice spot right down the street from the metro. No tv, which was great for us, made time there a little more personal (the time that we were). It was super comfy and clean!"
3156,215233,2019-09-27,"Todo fue increíble, el lugar, la pieza muy cómoda para una pareja o solitario, el baño limpio y cómodo buena ducha, Shailah es increíble muy agradable y con buena disposición. La ubicación lo mejor, cruzando está el central park, a pasos de metro con excelente conexión y tiendas convenientes para comer o farmacias. Amo el Upper West Side."
3157,856107,2021-08-30,"Exquisite,  unique,  views, and delicious coffee are some a few features that describe the BatCave. Waking up, you will really see Gotham city. If you love lots of natural light then  this is the place for you, it’s not only (Website hidden by Airbnb) well thought out. <br/><br/>We really enjoyed our time at The Bat Cave. <br/>Lucas is a delightful, thoughtful and extremely attentive host. He should be called a Megahost!!!! <br/><br/>Fantastic Stay and worth it!!!! We will definitely be back. <br/><br/>Thank you so much,  Lucas!"
3158,714019,2019-12-31,Doreshia’s house made our stay in New York truly memorable. From allowing us to use the driveway which made it easy for us to not think of parking to the convince of a good WiFi to a well set up house. My family was able to go to different local small restaurants or have our own dinner at home. The subway was easy to access too which made the experience of staying in New York a wonderful memory.
3159,795837,2020-08-17,We had an amazing weekend at sadies place.  <br/>We drove and parking wasn’t a problem around that area.  <br/>Lots of restaurants and bars.  <br/><br/>Thanks a lot 
3160,613834,2021-07-26,The world needs a gem like Nkem. So accommodating. Really went above and beyond to help me out.
3161,226688,2019-08-06,"We had a wonderful time staying here! The location is within a few blocks of subway and bus stops that made commuting around town simple and convenient. Rosangela was there to greet us for our check in and very easy to get a hold of throughout the trip! There are a lot of great places to eat within walking distance. We are more familiar with the New York area, but Rosangela also has plenty of great recommendations for activities and tips on how to navigate the area. I would highly recommend staying here!"
3162,246763,2021-09-03,"Enjoyed the stay! The place is quiet, clean. Parking on the street was easy. Would recommend."
3163,830180,2021-03-16,"This place is wonderful and exceeded my expectations. I didn’t know this place was a self check-in hotel. I didn’t mind, and was pleasantly surprised because it came with hotel amenities like toiletries, hair dryer, safe, iron and hangers, and extra linens. The check in process was easy and Jeniffer was gracious enough to let me check in early. The Airbnb and area felt safe. I would consider this Chinatown, but very close to Little Italy, LES and Soho. It was clean and had tons of natural light. Functioning thermostat. The place was amazing and I look forward to staying here again."
3164,872318,2021-11-22,Feel like home
3165,359395,2019-08-25,Excellent location and larger room than most Airbnb’s you can find in the city. Cats were great addition.
3166,801244,2020-07-11,"Nice, cozy, sunny private room! The room and the private bathroom were both nice and clean and they added an AC the day we came which was greatly appreciated! Would stay again!"
3167,697859,2020-12-27,I had a wonderful stay ! I will definitely be booking this place again whenever I visit
3168,777945,2021-06-20,"This was a great house to stay at and served our stay perfectly! Prabhdeep was a pleasure to deal with and if we ever have the need we will definitely stay there again! If you are looking in to this house, just book it! You won’t regret it and the house is as nice as the pictures or even better! I just wish he would own a house in any location that we go to in the future because he is doing it right!"
3169,430646,2021-10-10,"Had a great time, fully satisfied. Will return when I can!"
3170,842554,2020-12-19,"Justine was an awesome host! She provided great information about the area and answered all my questions so quickly! <br/><br/>The apartment is nice and homely, and so close to everything in Manhattan which made it fairly easy to walk to everything we wanted to do. For our next trip to NY, I'm definitely checking for this place first!"
3171,835074,2021-11-06,the place was very beautiful & clean !
3172,772653,2019-09-19,The apartment is so clean and I am so content with it.
3173,863527,2021-07-10,"Good location, near 2 subway stations for C and A line, 3 or 4 supermarkets open late night or early in the morning, the place is clean with practically everything you need. The host it’s available 24/7 to anything you need, it’s a nice place to stay."
3174,875656,2021-10-24,"we enjoyed our stay, the apartment looks exactly like on the pictures, very clean and neat. and additional tanks for letting us check out late because of our late flight, greatly appreciate it"
3175,756883,2019-10-09,Highly recommended
3176,824127,2021-06-21,This was a great stay! The hosts were super friendly—they helped find things to do in the city and were super accommodating. The bidet in the toilet was a big plus. The room was very clean and has plenty of natural light. Very close to the J and L trains and to various delis/bodegas. Overall super great value!
3177,809607,2021-08-10,"Adetunji’s place was a great location in Brooklyn, 40 minutes from Manhattan via the J train (which was only a few blocks away). The patio area was really nice to sit out on and there’s a few neighborhood friendly cats that roam. The place was well stocked with linens, dishes and air conditioning. The only two things that were frustrating were that the shower only had extremely hot water with no way to turn it down and the apartment is ONLY equipped with (Hidden by Airbnb) Home so there is no way to manually control the tv. Otherwise, I would recommend this listing to other travelers, especially if they were in NYC for a longer stay."
3178,773950,2020-02-01,"we enjoyed our stay. nice place in a perfect location. sure a bit noisy from the street, but hey, it is new york. (earplugs provided for those who need it)."
3179,581416,2019-03-29,Love this place!!!
3180,616764,2019-05-30,Logement Très bien situé. Très design et conforme à l’annonce. À quelques pas du métro. La communication est facile. Un petit magasin alimentaire qui se situe à quelque mètres. Très bon rapport qualité prix.
3181,655308,2019-08-20,"Ann and Allen was great hospitality.Their airbnb is convenient,clean,and delicious beagles  everything is good. I recommend."
3182,394122,2019-09-05,"Nice host, clear instructions for check in and check out. Clean place and lots of things in the neighborhood for eating."
3183,598435,2020-02-01,"Had a great stay here! The place is very clean and spacious. The beds are super comfy...the entire place is comfy actually! I really felt at home. Only thing I disliked was that the walls are very thin, so you just have to be mindful with volume. Also, the shower door only covers half the tub, so every time I showered the floors would get wet (which is not a big deal at all) Other than that, I had a wonderful stay. I recommend!!!"
3184,723545,2020-07-03,Great get away. Peaceful.
3185,535207,2019-09-25,We absolutely loved our stay here. The place is so stylish and lovely. The bed was very comfortable and everything was super clean! We will definitely be back!
3186,831401,2021-11-02,"Great spot! Stayed for a month in all, and cannot speak highly enough about the experience. Location is unbeatable: short walk to Central Park, right on a stretch of great bars and restaurants, across the street from Levain Bakery, and a stone’s throw from a great subway station. Apartment itself is as advertised: small, but has everything you need. Kitchen has a stove gas range, fridge and is well-equipped. Bed isn’t the most comfortable, but not bad. Very clean upon move in. Ignacio was also fantastic, as the only time I asked for something (an extra pan for the kitchen), it was delivered next day - great service. Thank you!"
3187,845856,2021-10-01,"Its right by JFK airport, short drive so if your flight gets canceled like mine did it’s a great option to stop by. The house was really nice, area wasn’t so bad, the rooms were really clean and so was the common area. The host communicates with you quickly. Everything there needed for a nice stay. The only problem is 10pm-2am there is very loud banging from upstairs, loud conversations, sounded like people were running around, pacing around the room. If you don’t have a NyQuil it will be very tough to sleep here. I saw other reviews about it and thought I could tough it out but I got no sleep at all. I ended calling quits and leaving at 3am to sleep at the airport since my flight was at 6am."
3188,272405,2021-05-23,"My boyfriend & I stayed here for a month long stay and we couldn’t have asked for a better spot!  The home was very clean, Kaitlyn was beyond welcoming and a great communicator, and on top of all that, the location was perfect. Hopefully will get the chance to stay here again the next time we’re in NYC because this place really felt like home!"
3189,667698,2020-07-05,"Great place, very quiet, relaxing and very clean. <br/>Parking is easy to find also."
3190,863563,2021-10-02,"A plush and comfortable stay! We booked this space for a romantic overnight getaway, and loved every moment of it. Feminine, soft, and clean, we chose to sleep in the back bedroom, and it was quiet and the bed was great! The furnishing and decoration was thoughtful, well-designed, pretty, and made it feel so luxurious for the cost. A great deal.<br/><br/>This would be ideal for a girls’ weekend in the city, cozy stay for bachelorette/bridal shower, or a romantic getaway like us. Furnished practically, with great storage and dressers, and kitchen that is lovely and all set for a comfortable longer stay as well.<br/><br/>We especially loved the bathtub and the TV! <br/><br/>(Note that if you need faster internet, you might need to use it in the front room or living room closer to the modem - it was too weak to use in the back room with the door shut for us.)"
3191,409000,2019-05-29,Great location. Wonderful host.
3192,558319,2019-11-12,"Would stay again, Asad is very kind and has a cute place!"
3193,368537,2020-01-01,"This was a nice stay! Jamie and Steve were very helpful to us during our trip. The room is very clean, the location of the residence is very good, near to the  subway station."
3194,849917,2021-01-24,"Beautiful hotel, with an amazing view! Would definitely recommend."
3195,872224,2021-07-20,"Chris & Megan are great hosts: they're super chill, very responsive, and even have a few recommendations of food/coffee places to check out around the neighborhood (there's a lot of good stuff). The apartment has a really cool layout, and the room I stayed in was quite homey and the bed was super comfortable. 10/10 would stay again."
3196,849542,2021-05-01,Host communication is a must and you can count on them!
3197,671351,2019-11-24,Great location and have privacy wich is really cool easy access to transportation
3198,795062,2020-11-12,Beautiful and stylish place. Great price for such a cozy place.
3199,447784,2019-10-15,"Katarina was a wonderful host with an awesome bnb. She was super accommodating to our needs and had lightning fast responses! Safe little area of town and very doable walk to the subway station. The air bnb itself was clean, bright and very spacious for two people. Found some favourite neighbourhood spots for coffee and pastries so I would definitely recommend staying here to have some relief from the hustle and bustle of Manhattan, and an easy going morning walk to the subway :) thank you Katarina!"
3200,834296,2021-03-19,"Very nice inside, very clean"
3201,846189,2021-01-17,"I wouldn’t say it was warm and cozy but it was definitely good for the value. Convenient location very close to the beautiful Fort Tyron park and right off the A train. Clean. Prompt communication from the host. Bedroom was kinda sad but again, very good stay for the price. It is in a walk-up only building so be weary if you or a guest can’t go up stairs."
3202,657923,2019-12-28,"Pour les français qui veulent se rendre à New York, l’appartement de Zain est vraiment parfait pour une famille de six personnes: il est situé au rdc d.une maison dans un quartier calme du queens. Il se compose de trois chambre, d’une salle de bain, d’un salon et d’une petite cuisine. Il manque cependant une passoire et un plat pour le four. Il n’y a pas de table ni de chaises, nous avons dû prendre les repas du soir sur la table basse mais cela n’a pas posé de problème.<br/>La station de métro woodside est à quelques minutes à pied et dessert la ligne 7 qui se rend directement à grand central et Times square.<br/>Il y a un grand supermarché key food à 10 min à pied sur queens boulevard <br/>Zain répond très vite à nos questions et nous a autoriser à laisser nos bagages jusqu’au soir le derniers jour de notre séjour <br/>Nous étions très contents le soir de retourner dans la location au calme après une journée dans New York au milieu du bruit et de la foule <br/>Nous recommandons grandement cette location, vous ne serez pas déçus"
3203,850768,2021-10-21,Great value stay. Close to train and gives you everything you need.
3204,314794,2019-12-15,Nicholas’s place is pretty quiet for NYC standards and well priced. I stayed with my partner for a 3 month business trip and this place had everything we needed to stay here comfortably and allow me to work from home. It’s close to the F and N lines and about 30 minutes to downtown Brooklyn. The owner is considerate and responsive.
3205,865594,2021-07-25,Instantly from walking in I knew I was guaranteed the stay I was offered. Peaceful and quiet with well mannered and helpful staff to help make my stay the best it could be. The bar was phenomenal and the front desk was more than happy to help as well as answer any of my questions. Room is not big but aesthetically pleasing and clean. Great room for two.
3206,769540,2020-02-16,"Nice host, nice place!"
3207,619109,2019-08-16,"I had a great visit at Rnl’s apartment. They were attentive to my needs, communicated well and were very nice!<br/><br/>The apartment was clean and comfortable. I will stay there again if I can!"
3208,470974,2019-05-12,Michael’s place is super cute just like the photos and well located close to the subway which will get you to Manhattan in about 20 minutes. The bed was super comfy but know that “loft” means no door which  wasn’t an issue because Michael is super kind and respectful . He’s also super quick to communicate and offer suggestions about New York and explain how things work. I’d definitely recommend Michael’s place for those wanting to stay in beautiful Brooklyn. Enjoy!
3209,505220,2019-09-26,"Everything great, thank you!"
3210,754731,2021-11-14,"Location is fantastic. The room is spacious and comfortable. Bed was soft and clean. <br/><br/>Cleanliness: bathroom is quite moldy. Underside of bed really needs cleaned. Kitchen was clean. Room itself was clean besides under the bed. <br/><br/>The hallway of this 2 bedroom apartment has been turned into a third bedroom. So, for us to use the restroom, we needed to walk past someone’s bed while they were trying to sleep. We thought this was weird and rude, so we only had one alternative whenever we had to use the restroom:<br/><br/>Use the side exit of our room, walk down a hallway outside our apartment, unlock the front door of the apartment, use restroom, lock front door again, walk back outside our room, unlock our room door, and enter our room. <br/><br/>This became extremely stupid after a night. The person staying in the middle hallway room would loudly grumble and complain whenever I used the restroom at night because I had to make a bunch of noise unlocking and locking the front door of the apartment which was right next to their bed. <br/><br/>All in all, host was respectful, kind, and fast with communicating. Room was spacious and comfortable. Bathroom situation and having to go outside the apartment every time we needed to use the restroom was pretty annoying. Cleanliness under the bed and bathroom was subpar."
3211,738770,2019-11-30,Incredible space in an incredible location!  This apartment has a great kitchen and space to relax in over the holidays with modern and clean decor. The hosts were fantastic and were always available to answer questions and give recommendations on restaurants. We would love to stay here again!
3212,829370,2021-06-07,"All around fantastic room! Great location, cleanliness and amenities. Easy access to Brooklyn, Queens and Manhattan. A great room for a weekend visit or full vacation. Backyard was an amazing bonus! Couldn’t recommend more highly!"
3213,452763,2020-01-09,Great location and very welcoming hosts!
3214,595614,2021-09-28,We stayed for a couple of weeks and the place was a really good stay if you want to visit Brooklyn or get around Manhattan. The Franklin Av subway station is pretty close and you can take the A/C train to the big island
3215,840262,2021-04-18,"Great stay, would love to go back."
3216,541088,2021-10-13,Muy amable !!!
3217,680668,2019-01-26,Vera’s place is an excellent choice for a NYC  accommodation. The apartment was very clean and it was recently renovated inside which is not common in NY.  Sheets and towels were clean and it was quiet at the time to sleep. Absolutely a good pick outside of manhattan. Subway is within close distance to building.
3218,846898,2021-05-06,"Honestly, one word FANTASTIC. <br/><br/>Karen was amazing. She answered every single call VERY quickly. Her home was outstandingly clean and very well equipped. She was also super personable she gave my boyfriend and I a full walk through of her property upon arrival. <br/><br/>I think in future I will look at this property as my first option when coming to Brooklyn. <br/><br/>Karen, thank you so much!"
3219,135436,2019-06-05,"I really enjoyed my stay in Mrs. Eva's apartment. I traveled to NYC to take a test and I stayed for two nights. The place was very clean and organized. Mrs. Eva is an amazing host. She is very kind. She gave me tips about subway routes and places to visit. Also, she gave me privacy at all times. And, she offered me coffee and breakfast first time in the morning. I would definitely rent the room again if I am back to NYC! I would highly recommend Mrs Eva's Place."
3220,313478,2019-09-30,"Great place, very big, nice backyard to hangout."
3221,482678,2019-11-09,Basement was clean and check in details were clear. Rachel was extremely responsive and such a great host!  <br/>Expect 40-50 minute subway to time square. Thanks Rachel
3222,844664,2021-02-08,"Beautiful place, checkin was very easy. I loved the open floor plan most of all. Would recommend and would stay again. Thanks Elias"
3223,211264,2019-09-27,This spot is GREAT. Felt right at home. Terrific! Splendid! Relaxing! Would definitely stay there again!
3224,781627,2020-01-26,"We loved our stay at the duplex. Tommy was very responsive to any questions we had when preparing for our nyc weekend, and his partner David was helpful when we got onsite with answering any questions we had.  The apartment is a fourth story walk-up so prepare for stairs, but the apartment was spacious and clean.  We were a large group (10) and were so happy to all be able to stay together so comfortably!"
3225,844884,2021-01-03,"Really enjoyed my stay, great price, exceptionally clean, the owners were very friendly thoughtful and knowledgeable. Can't wait until I get a chance to use these guys again. I highly recommend"
3226,613246,2020-11-10,Amazing place! Loved being able to watch the sunrise and set along the water! Beautiful mostly quiet area. Great for a nice getaway!
3227,712615,2020-03-31,"Steve was a great host with a great apartment. My room was essentially the size of a small studio. The location was easily accessible to the subway and other public transportation. If you are looking for peace, quiet and privacy then this is the place to book."
3228,642883,2019-10-14,A good budget place to stay in NYC for the budget traveller.
3229,665186,2020-06-30,Awesome hidden little gem!  Noriko is awesome and took care of everything. We will be back!
3230,554654,2019-12-16,Hosts are wonderful people and couldn’t ask for a better experience staying in New York. Definitely recommended!
3231,837949,2021-10-01,"nice, clean stay"
3232,685298,2019-11-08,"This place is the best Air Bnb I’ve ever stayed in. Nice and polite guy. Neat to the teeth. Max is amazing too. You guys should drop by here if you ever come to Harlem. The room has this vibe. It’s worth the experience trust me you won’t be disappointed.  Listen. My friend referred me to this place and I’m referring you alll. DONT MIss it. <br/><br/>I like the Disco light effect MAX Good Job!! <br/>Ok I feel like writing more reviews, what else do I write ? - Room Smellls great!! The Dyson heater was perfect. I felt like I was in a massage room. Once I got into the room I slept like a BABY who just had a warm bath. <br/><br/>Anything else ? I can go on and on. Bye guys. Just check it out. Experience is the best teacher"
3233,774725,2019-12-30,"Wonderful Brooklyn gem, tons of space, close to Subway and lots of local flavor."
3234,717637,2020-03-20,This is my second time staying at this bnb and he’s very helpful and generous the place is beautiful and comfortable everything Easy to get to
3235,406694,2021-07-17,Easy check-in and quick response to questions. The stand up shower was a bit small to shave in.
3236,525721,2020-01-01,"This is far and away the best AirBnB experience I’ve ever had, and sincerely I could not recommend these hosts or their apartment any more highly. We’ve already referred this place to numerous friends and family who are interested in visiting NYC. Their apartment is beautiful and the location is unbelievable, it’s actually kind of shocking how quickly you can be standing in Times Square, or at the Rockefeller Center/Radio City, or at Central Park, or at any number of can’t-miss NY attractions after a short leisurely walk out of their apartment. We didn’t have to take a single taxi or Uber/Lyft during our entire stay, simply because of the stellar location we were able to walk everywhere or use the subway access right around the corner, and that alone saved us a fortune. And their block in Hell’s Kitchen is just outside of the main tourist thoroughfares so when you get back to it after a long day of sightseeing, you really feel like you’re escaping into your own cozy pocket of Manhattan. We were there for one of the busiest times of the year over the holidays and New Years, and despite being so close to everything, their apartment is amazingly quiet, comfortable and serene. We had no problem stopping in for a power nap between meals or trips around the city and the room and bed were wonderful.<br/><br/>Aside from the apartment and location, the real magic of this AirBnB experience is in its wonderful hosts Larry and Raúl. We first met Larry who was incredibly gracious and welcoming and made us feel like old friends when we were just getting settled in NYC. He made us feel at home right away and was so much fun to chat with and get a local’s take on the New York experience. He had great recommendations for cool local bars, delis, places to get groceries that were literally down the block or around the corner. He made himself available to us if ever we needed anything while also being so courteous and giving us plenty of space to rest and recoup from our long trip. The next day we met Raúl who is incredibly cool and kind, and after talking for a long while, he even graciously invited us to celebrate New Years Eve with him and a few friends if we wanted since we didn’t have any concrete plans for the night. He and his friends took us right in and made us feel like family. We had a blast at some local bars for drinks and dancing, we shared in awesome Colombian & Venezuelan New Year’s Eve traditions, toasted champagne, and right after the ball drop there was a magical rooftop proposal that my fiancé and I will forever cherish. Ringing in the New Year with these guys and their amazing friends in the greatest city in the world, it’s something we will absolutely never forget. We will be coming back to visit 100%!!!"
3237,491833,2019-12-27,"Joy's and John's place is really nice and the appartment has everything you need. the area around is ok, not the nicest in new york but really ok. metro is a 5 minute walk and about a 10 minute ride to one world trade center and 20 minute ride to tmes square. joy and john are super friendly and communication was easy going. heater in the room is quite a bit loud, but thats everything i can say that was not good in the room ;). for the price in that area, definitely a rec from us. cheers"
3238,771946,2020-11-29,"Good place, cozy, all food places are a bit of a walk and the kitchen is shared w/ other tenants, but the place is cozy and clean"
3239,665187,2020-07-30,Noriko is a great host responds quickly
3240,706226,2019-07-04,"Excelente servicio! Todo muy limpio, el lugar es muy acogedor y agradable para pasar una estadía! Muchísimas gracias por la amabilidad brindada."
3241,881171,2021-11-06,Beauty was a very nice host. We enjoyed our stay.
3242,677542,2019-09-13,"Carlos and Vielca were very responsive and accommodating hosts! They gave us our space while still being very accessible. Please know that the mattress on the bed is a true memory foam and sinks in a lot, which caused some discomfort, but that could have just been our personal preference. The location is fantastic, right by the 6 train and local laundromats, restaurants, and Rite Aid with a grocery store a short walk away. We would definitely stay here again!"
3243,806242,2021-02-21,Very nice stay!
3244,775711,2021-05-05,Black Foot has the Best Air BNB in Town !
3245,325746,2019-02-15,首先位置非常不错，中央公园就在旁边，走下去就是第五大道。整体也比较干净。厨房挺大挺不错的哈哈哈。一楼开门的小姐姐大哥哥人也很好，快递在这拿哦。另外洗衣机和扔垃圾都在basement，没有想象的那么麻烦。我们四个人在这住了一个月，比房东拍的照片感觉要大一些，还是挺开心哒。<br/>Really good location! 0.3 mile away from central park. The girl who helped open the door is really nice!! We really enjoy the month spent in this hotel!
3246,870428,2021-09-05,"Amazing service, great place to stay for the weekend! We felt very accommodated and very comfortable! Joseph was extremely acclimating and helpful throughout the whole trip!"
3247,810285,2021-03-15,"The space is super clean physically and energetically. The space is lovely, I love how they decorated. The bed is super comfortable, the temperature is perfect, the shower is good, I was very content. I actually wished I would have booked longer to get to know the hosts a bit more who are really phenomenal people. The vibes are really great and they have very good communication. I highly recommend!"
3248,765022,2019-11-10,"I stayed with Abdoulaye and his family for one month and they were very kind and accommodating. They always offered me some of their tasty food,had a Keurig for my coffee needs, and wonderful conversation when we had time. <br/><br/>The place is close to many bus stops, 2&5 train, and a grocery store. I felt safe in their home and the area. The room itself is cozy and neat with a mini fridge."
3249,470387,2019-12-04,Chambre et salle de bain propres; Très bonne literie. Appartement très bien placé dans Williamsburg et à un peu moins de 10mn du métro. Un peu bruyant. Peu de contact avec les propriétaires. Dommage
3250,648811,2021-01-28,Great home great service
3251,867207,2021-10-10,"As my first time staying in NYC, it was interesting to get a taste of ""where the locals live."" The airbnb was lovely, Jakob  was great, but next time I'll probably pick somewhere less than an hour commute to the city."
3252,891498,2021-11-23,I totally recommend this place!
3253,435302,2019-01-27,"Great space and great location, 5 minutes from the subway which we used to get around while staying there!"
3254,444606,2019-09-22,"Mark and Will truly are Superhosts. They are great conversationalists and are very helpful in getting around on the subway.  Their home is 5 short blocks from the 1 train that takes you right to downtown Manhattan. Their home is spacious and comfortable and our bedroom was large with a comfortable bed. Raissa is a lovely pup that greets you at the door begging for scratches and rubs. There is no cooking in their home but it isn’t necessary. There are wonderful deli’s close by that serve superb breakfasts. Bring cash as a lot of restaurants are on a cash basis and don’t have Visa, especially in Chinatown. We had a lovely stay."
3255,478952,2020-03-02,"This place was great! Quiet, clean, neat attic loft with plenty of space.  Close to city transportation without the riffraff.  The keyless entry was so cool with all the needed security to feel safe. Loved that parking was so easy as well.  It felt like home away from home."
3256,739382,2021-05-14,"Such an sweet amazing host! I highly recommend this place! The C train right on the end of the block, amazing coffee shop right down stairs, and a cute private patio."
3257,752262,2020-01-30,"The apartment is pleasant and in a great location. From reviews, I expected it to be cleaner than it was. I enjoyed nice personal touches and artwork."
3258,78818,2019-12-22,Super cozy adorable place
3259,699687,2021-06-04,"Amazing place , sparkling clean , definitely coming back again"
3260,162154,2019-10-12,"The room was in a great location, close to everything I wanted to do and see by Subway. I really enjoyed staying locally in Brooklyn. I did not meet the host in person."
3261,700552,2021-08-12,"Beautiful apartment, super clean and comfortable! Close to the subway on a quiet residential street. Owner is very prompt with answers to questions — this was the BEST home base for our city adventures!"
3262,337395,2019-08-13,this is an hostel. beds are uncomfortable and tiny. <br/><br/>good location
3263,297000,2019-03-31,"Fabulous apartment, with everything you could possibly need or want.  Great location. Can't wait to return!"
3264,664784,2019-05-17,"The apartment was absolutely fabulous exactly like the photos, we stayed for two month and it was home away from home"
3265,803158,2021-05-16,"This was such an amazing experience! Being it was my boyfriend and I’s first trip to New York, thinking about a place to stay was a hassle but staying here was so great I can’t even put it into words! Accommodations and communication was amazing and would recommend staying here anytime!"
3266,638266,2020-09-08,"Georgina’s  place was my best Air BNB experience. It's an accurate description, convenient location, clean space, easy to make food there so you don't always have to go out to each, and she's very responsive to messages. I'd highly recommend staying here!"
3267,552333,2021-09-22,"siempre recibirán una cálida bienvenida, te sentiras en casa desde tú llegada."
3268,415610,2019-10-20,"My mom and I had such a lovely stay with Ruth. Her home is beautiful and cosy, very well situated with both bus and subway options nearby. She is so welcoming and gave us many tips and recommendations of places to eat, things to see and the best ways to get around the city - we felt very at ease and had a great time!"
3269,706062,2019-10-06,"The apartment was perfect for our needs!  We were only there for one night, but it would've been sufficient for a longer stay.  The three bedrooms accommodated our three families that were there that included 6 adults, two teenagers and two toddlers.  There is not a common area or living room if you are using all three bedrooms, but they are big enough to be able to spend time in.  There is also a small but full kitchen with a table where a couple of people could be at the same time.  The two little ones loved the running up and down the hallway and exploring in the middle closet.  There are plenty of places in the neighborhood to get good food and/or coffee.  It was close to the subway which was a bonus when you've got kids and bags in tow.  Furthermore, Lakisha is an awesome host who was very helpful with directions, instructions and providing amenities such as towels, blankets, toiletries, etc. and who quickly responded to questions.  Lastly, the cost to stay in a beautiful home in Brooklyn where we could all be together was so much more reasonable than a small motel/hotel room where we would've been split up and without the personal touches that were here.  I would definitely stay again on our next trip to the city."
3270,705827,2021-04-18,"Este lugar es pésimo, muy sucio el baño, la cocina esta en malas condiciones, en esa casa fuman mucha marihuana todo él tiempo se huele olor a marihuana. El sitio no seguro. Yo no recomiendo ese hospedaje."
3271,302421,2019-03-17,This place is exactly what it looks like on the app and it has such a convenient location for anyone going to JFK since it’s like 10 minutes away. I didn’t see anyone and it’s a really quiet neighborhood which is perfect for me since I’m not all that talkative and I value peace. Would definitely stay again!!
3272,873491,2021-11-22,"Great location! 10 min walk to the train. Cute apartment! Host was very responsive and helpful throughout our trip. The only thing I wish is that the couch was normal size, it’s more like a miniature couch so not great for lounging but the beds worked perfectly!"
3273,874092,2021-09-26,"This place is in a very convenient spot in the upper west side. One block away from the downtown subway, and places to eat."
3274,134891,2019-02-24,"Jorge as a host exhibits great hospitality and offers so many thoughtful gestures. He's the best! Very accommodating and also very kind. The home has many amenities, alot more than you'll find at most places. It's clean and private, an absolutely wonderful place to stay at. It's also close to the J train and lots of food spots too. Lastly, it can't be overstated just how great of a host Jorge is, he's perhaps the best one you'll ever come across. It was a pleasure to stay here."
3275,299597,2021-09-09,"There were some nice positives about the places, and a few negatives.  It’s very affordable so if that’s what you need, that it what you will get here! <br/><br/>The host was extremely flexible about check in and check out, which was so helpful as I had a late flight. They were also very communicative via the app and helped me with a task I needed for travel. The decor is nice and the place is on a quiet side street, with a bus stop around the corner that takes you to various subway lines. (There is not a near subway) There’s a really great coffee shop and a very good brewery a few blocks away.  The area is quaint and fairly quiet, which is nice to get away to after a day going around the city. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, bathroom didn’t seem like it had been cleaned in a while- dust and mildew on surfaces indicated this. The bed is very firm and creaky, and there is only one thin pillow offered. Also flannel sheets in summer were far too hot. The host has all storage/shelf space in the room full, so don’t expect to put away any belongings. The listing says the kitchen can be used, but I didn’t really feel that was the case upon arrival- I felt a bit more like an intruder than a guest. I am also very shy so this could be a projection, but I decided it was better not to use the kitchen. <br/><br/>Overall, it’s a cheap spot in NY and the host is very flexible and understanding of travel and it’s unavoidable hiccups."
3276,734216,2019-07-17,Great host! The place was incredible and had everything you need for your stay! His restaurant across the  street has great pizza.
3277,842582,2021-09-20,Great Host & Home for a stay in BK!
3278,384426,2020-02-17,"Amazing stay at Dawn’s place, great location, very clean. Dawn was very quick to respond to my questions and even let me check in early."
3279,112077,2021-11-01,"This was everything that my husband and I needed. It was the perfect size for just the two of us and the neighborhood wasn’t even in a rough place. It was easy to get to the subway station to get to where we needed to be. Honestly, I couldn’t have found a much better place than this! They are both extremely nice people and are helpful if you needed any help. If I ever do come back to New York, I’ll be sure to book this place again, it was truly a great place!"
3280,176773,2019-10-17,とても親切でﾌﾚﾝﾄﾞﾘｰなﾎｽﾄでした。部屋もきれいでﾘｯﾁもよくてﾆｭｰﾖｰｸの滞在を楽しめました。
3281,657524,2019-06-02,"A great place to stay! Edna’s was very accommodating but she also gave us our own space. It was very clean and the location was perfect, never more than a couple minute walk to a store like target or to the subway."
3282,652642,2021-06-20,Great location and listing! The room and bathroom were very clean and spacious. AC unit helped a lot with the NY summer heat!
3283,621112,2021-11-19,"Couldn’t have been a better stay. Kemar was a fantastic host, and the facilities and location are top notch. Would stay again."
3284,663319,2021-01-10,Incredible place to stay! Hospitality is so great and totally worth it. Highly recommend and definitely staying here next time!
3285,883706,2021-10-17,"excellent stay! great place, great host"
3286,307530,2019-09-05,"Recomiendo vivamente el departamento de Lizzy y Ryan para una estancia puramente neoyorquina. Tiene una ubicación perfecta, en el Upper West Side a una manzana y media de Central Park. Hay varias paradas de metro y bus a menos de cinco minutos, muy conveniente para moverse por la ciudad.<br/>El apartamento es tal como aparece en las fotos, y en realidad los espacios son mayores de lo que se ve en las fotos. Es ideal para una pareja, también puede admitir una familia con uno o dos hijos pequeños, como en nuestro caso. Dispone de una habitación con una cama enorme muy mullida, a través de la cual se accede al balcón, donde hay una mesa y sillas para desayunar o cenar (cuando hace ben tiempo). En el salón el sofá es grande, en nuestro caso dormía uno de los niños. Además Ryan nos proporcionó un colchón auto-hinchable, totalmente nuevo, que colocamos al lado del sofá.<br/>La comunicación con Ryan fue muy fluida todo el tiempo, especialmente inmediata durante nuestra estancia para responder cualquier duda. Sin embargo el check-in lo realizamos con Rudy, quien me llamó directamente por teléfono para confirmar nuestra llegada.<br/>El apartamento dispone de una cocina perfectamente equipada junto al salón, nosotros desayunamos y cenamos en el apartamento casi todos los días, en el balcón. En el interior no se dispone de tanto sitio, sobre todo para una familia. Para una pareja no habría problema en alguna de las mesas auxiliares del salón. La decoración es exquisita, cocina y baño en perfecto estado, y muy limpio.<br/>Estuvimos encantados, y ojalá en un futuro podamos volver a NYC, repetiríamos sin duda."
3287,856486,2021-08-18,"great place to stay at for the price, nice view"
3288,379161,2019-11-06,"Glenn is an excellent host, very kind. His place is very comfortable and the location is amazing. I really recommend the Glenn’s place to enjoy NYC."
3289,337221,2021-11-14,Perfect spot to relax after a full day of NYC exploration.  Close to everything great value for money .
3290,625727,2019-01-31,I spent a few lovely weeks & will be back again soon. Lovely couple & family. Could not expect anything more. F
3291,814357,2021-01-06,This place is a perfect spot to spend your vacation. Very clean and nice place
3292,879194,2021-07-24,We stay in this room for 2 days and it was good.<br/>Brenda was really helpful and she's answer at all the questions I have made.<br/>She's even let us bring the luggage before the check in.<br/>The location was perfect because is 5min walk from the subway. <br/>I really recommend ☺️ <br/>Thank you ☺️
3293,452539,2019-04-27,The location is perfect. A quiet area with many bars and restaurant all around and 2 subway stations within walking distance. Our host always answered quickly and nicely to our questions before and during our stay. The place was clean and comfortable. I recommand this place.
3294,886101,2021-10-29,Daniela is sweet and understanding. Her house is very spacious in the living room and bed room. My favorite thing was the plants and she has books everywhere that you can enjoy when eating or having a cup of coffee. Over all she’s very chill and flexible. Everything was close by my stay felt so relaxed and I felt safe as well. Def would recommend.
3295,122096,2021-01-06,Its a nice place
3296,832334,2021-12-04,Simplement parfait !
3297,539429,2019-09-23,"Lovely, and beautiful living area.  Abundant amenities.  Very clean.  Maggy went above and beyond.  I will be back if life takes me back to Brooklyn."
3298,813191,2021-03-27,"I’ve stayed here before and every time it’s the most pleasant. Thanks for being so consistent, Emmanuel."
3299,410246,2021-01-31,"Sebastian's place is a wonderfully cozy place! It is everything you'll need for your stay in New York, whether it is a short or extended stay. Even for the things it may lack like a washer/dryer in building, you can find everything either around the corner or just a few minutes away! Sebastian himself was very nice and always quick to respond to any questions we had. Overall, a great stay!"
3300,193633,2020-01-25,Oates and Bill are wonderful hosts! They go above and beyond to make your stay very comfortable and you will feel totally at home. The house is super nice and in a great location as well! Plus they have the friendliest cats :) I would definitely stay again.
3301,569776,2019-12-02,"We had Luz take care of us. She was very kind to show us around, and we felt very much home.<br/>Many delis, and local supermarkets in the area.<br/>On the last day, we could keep our luggage there for the whole day and do the remaining sight seeing. <br/><br/>Overall it was really great.<br/>Would recommend it to anyone coming to newyork and wanna do an economical trip."
3302,364442,2019-04-21,"Lovely space, with a super cool (and classic NY) balcony all to yourself! The bed is super comfortable and we loved the starry light projection. Excellent location with food and drinks all within a stone’s throw. Highly recommend."
3303,718261,2019-11-28,Excellent for the NYC commuter! Easy check-in and very friendly!
3304,560802,2019-02-18,Best place to stay in Brooklyn! Close to the trains and to great restaurants and bars. Host are friendly and laid back. They made me wanna move to NY. When I come back I definitely want to stay here again!
3305,535035,2020-02-09,"Staying here was awesome! Maria and Ricardo are such Great host. They are professional photographers as well. We had a shoot outside and in their private studio. If you want a comfortable stay come here. Everything is the same at the photos. Bathroom is a little tight, but that’s New York."
3306,382691,2019-09-16,Excellent
3307,824465,2021-07-12,Excellent apartment in a great Williamsburg location.
3308,749393,2019-11-20,A very nice clean place. Modern and close to subways which makes for easy travel. Central Park is just a few blocks away. Highly recommend. Welcome amenities were a nice touch.
3309,17723,2019-04-06,"Anthony was very kind and helpful throughout every step. His clear communication and instructions were very helpful for my stay. The room was very spacious, clean, and had everything I needed (and more). I lived in the area so I know my way around but it is a fantastic location near transportation, food, bars, you name it. Totally will book again in the future! Thanks again Anthony!"
3310,835502,2021-10-17,"Good for if you need a place to sleep while visiting New York. Subway is close (7 minutes), but the neighborhood itself is not exciting. Has a small kitchen and each door is locked with a code. Building is also pretty new and with AC. Communication was easy and check in worked well without host present. Bathroom is shared with other rooms and did not feel very clean when i visited. Overall a smooth experience."
3311,740955,2019-10-27,"You can expect a host that cares about you and your needs. The space was clean, had a wonderful touch of home, and was in a great location for our traveling needs. The host even had snacks on the counter and water bottles in the fridge. It was a wonderful stay, and great value! Would definitely stay again!"
3312,648453,2019-08-26,"It was a great space for me personally, a place I could relax after a hard day exploring. Having access to the bathroom and shower was great. Thanks Kandi."
3313,569382,2019-09-17,"My girlfriend and I stayed here for 5 nights September 12th to 16th. Location was great, 12 minute walk to subway station and about 20 minutes total to get to downtown Manhattan. I chatted with Peter a few times during the trip and he gave some great suggestions for trip planning. Overall had a great stay and I will definitely try to stay there again on my next New York trip."
3314,517158,2019-09-30,"Great value for money overall, clean place, stylish, conveniently located near a train station and a lot of shops/restaurants etc."
3315,717382,2019-10-06,"Pros:<br/>-Apartment/efficiency was very clean and they wrote a nice card to us and left us wine.<br/><br/>Cons: <br/>-Host hired contractors to work on her backyard, which the apartment overlooks, and she didn’t tell us until arrival (she has a strict cancellation policy). The neighbors also were doing construction and jackhammering at 7 am every morning. <br/><br/>-It was supposed to have onsite parking but she made me move my car 3 times on and off the street because of the contractors vehicles. <br/><br/>-The apartment isn’t insulated very well and the a/c unit in the window in the bedroom is taped to the window using tape and there are little areas where the outside is completely exposed. The insulation also causes the apartment to be very cold and you can hear everything outside and upstairs. <br/><br/>-The listing is really far from the subway, about 15-20 minute walk and cafes and places to eat are also too far to walk. <br/><br/>-There was ground coffee but no coffee filters or a coffee maker and she told us that the coffee was instant and we tried it, and it was clearly not and undrinkable."
3316,821920,2021-06-13,Jorge's place is in a great location. There are tons of great restaurants within walking distance of the apartment. The apartment is spacious and clean. The noise level at night is not bad.
3317,786078,2020-12-06,Amazing hospitality!
3318,108291,2019-11-03,"Good location, safe, clean, and easy. Lenore was quick at responding and very helpful. Would recommend."
3319,818429,2021-05-02,"Excellent, thorough quick communication. Nice place that met our expectations!"
3320,361930,2021-02-01,"Great stay in an amazing location. Fantastic, responsive communication from Karen. Really appreciated the basket of snacks, the coffeemaker, the microwave, and the frig. Super comfortable mattress. Outside the door are dozens of restaurants and stores. Highly recommend."
3321,734710,2021-09-28,"Had a great stay at Lotay’s. Very communicative and spacious. Easy walk to the train, cute Mexican restaurants around the area."

3326,813989,2020-11-03,"Could not ask for a more hospitable, more inviting host! If we needed anything he was there to make sure it was an enjoyable stay. We will definitely be back!"
3327,871529,2021-08-08,"LOVELY space. Much bigger in person than how appears on photos, except the bathroom is reeeally tiny. I’m a skinny person and could barely fit my shoulders in to use the bathroom sink area. Loved everything else though. Clean + open space, eclectic decor, the sweetest and friendly host, and THE BEST location for Williamsburg. You gotta try the restaurant right outside the apt too, it’s *chefs kiss*"
3328,512903,2021-04-05,The place is very nice more than enough room for two people.
3329,206780,2019-11-22,"What a great place. Right off the Surrounded by almost every kind of food you could think of. And the room was spectacular. Exactly how it  looks in the photos, maybe better. And Crysdian was a great host, making sure everything was just right."
3330,46,2019-08-21,"First of all I have to say, that Jennifer is not allowed to sublet her apartment by her landlord. I was instructed by her to not mention airbnb to anybody beforehand, which was fine, but one evening I was stopped by her landlord in the hallway and questioned about where I am staying, how long, where Jennifer is etc. Afterwards, although I didn’t say anything wrong, Jennifer freaked out about it, and I really thought for a few hours that I would have to move out and find another place to stay right away. From that point on I felt really unsafe there and always tried to hide from the landlord. <br/><br/>For my stay the apartment was also not ideal, there is no couch, only cushions on the floor and there is no real table and chairs. I had to work from home sometimes and could not really do it anywhere. <br/>The place was really clean in general, only the bathroom and the shower were really not okay. Especially the shower curtain was mildewed. <br/>The kitchen was clean and well equipped. <br/>Apartment has an AC, which is definitely a pro. <br/><br/>Also, what should be mentioned , the hallway is really narrow and the stairs are quite steep, so with a huge suitcase not ideal, as the apartment is walk-up to the 4th floor.<br/><br/>The location of the apartment is alright, in my opinion it is a bit busy in that area and there are nicer places to live, bit that is just my personal opinion."
3331,346241,2019-09-02,"Erica & Jon's place was sparkling clean, in a great location, and very quiet. We would happily stay there again. Highly recommend."

3333,829102,2021-02-15,I enjoyed my stay
3334,435106,2019-09-09,My mom and I had a really nice staying at Simone‘s apartment! We had good conversations and felt home!
3335,524080,2019-10-29,Very nice. Felt at home.

3337,682987,2019-11-06,"Спасибо большое Софии за гостеприимство,помощь,всё понравилось,квартира находится рядом с метро,спокойный и безопасный район,в шаговой доступности все магазины и кафе!)"
3338,876938,2021-08-23,Beautiful home.
3339,778387,2021-07-03,"Quiet and good AC for summer. Most of time, you will not see anyone else in the house."
3340,891702,2021-11-19,Clean small room for a good price.  Motel style apartment.  Facilities are clean including the shared bathroom. Good for people looking for a place to crash and not deal with an Air BNB owner.
3341,767021,2021-08-22,Phenomenal location! Great food nearby
3342,664076,2021-07-08,"Great place, conveniently located, nice family, you have your own bathroom, fridge and microwave. Couldn’t ask for much more. I’ll be recommending it to my friends and family when they come to the city."
3343,594057,2019-07-21,"Very convenient location in Flushing (close to Main Street and to public transportation), and very nice and clean apartment.  Tony and Cyrus we’re extremely helpful and super responsive.  Everything from check-in to check-out was seamless.  The parking space arrangement is a nice plus for those driving."
3344,886216,2021-09-21,"DO NOT BOOK HERE<br/><br/>Fresh to New York, my daughter and I trekked our lives across the country in as many suitcases and boxes that we could check into our flight. The first few weeks we sublet in Brooklyn and then moved into Outpost Cassa Residency which was booked through Airbnb so that we could be closer to my daughters school. Even before we got to the hotel we were told the room we had booked had to have repairs done and that they would place us in separate rooms. We noticed some issues with both of these rooms, including a towel that smelt like sewage and not being thoroughly clean, even though the hotel claimed on Airbnb to partake in the ""enhanced clean"" protocol due to Covid. However, we didn't make a big deal of it and dealt with the issues on our own because we knew it would be temporary.<br/><br/>After a few days the room we originally booked was ready for us to move into. We repacked and shlepped our ten bags, boxes and suitcases into the new room. Upon entering we were greeted with an overwhelming odor of toxic chemicals and floors dirty that it was impossible to avoid transferring the dirt to our beds, clothing and other surfaces. We moved into our room on a Thursday and I was told the room could not be cleaned until Monday. However, even more concerning was being placed in a room with dangerous toxic fumes. Immediately I had requested to move us to another room and I was told they were at 100% occupancy. I went immediately to open the window to try to escape the dangerous fumes, only to find the window was broken and did not open. In New York, even in the best of circumstances, it is illegal for hotels to have rooms that do not have windows that open. This left my daughter and I trapped in a room with no escape from the fumes.<br/><br/>After the first night's sleep I woke up with my lungs hurting and the fumes placed me in a stupor where I had a lack of awareness, was incredibly tired and foggy brained. My concern was also placed with my daughter's lungs and throat, because she has been training to become a professional singer. <br/><br/>At first I thought it was paint fumes, but while conversing with another guest who had a similar experience with their room that they thought the smell was from newly varnished counters. These chemicals penetrate the lungs during inhalation and accumulate on the fibrous walls of these vital organs, causing irritation and swelling. Lacquer poisoning can cause many alarming symptoms throughout the body. Also according to Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, prolonged exposure to lacquer fumes can cause serious, long-term problems in the lungs and brain, including the risk of cancer. <br/><br/>Staying in this room could have been life threatening. Imagine if my or my daughter contracted Covid, while the toxins had broken down our immune systems and lungs. I made it abundantly clear to Airbnb and the host the severity of the situation."
3345,309316,2019-08-23,Christopher is very friendly and the apartment was clean :) <br/>The location is really good :)
3346,841028,2021-03-29,"Angelica was so helpful. Clean covers, clean towels, clean everything. Perfect location from Times Square. Just amazing."
3347,645058,2019-04-23,"Grant was a pleasure to work with setting up arrangements and his location was phenomenal. Clean, cozy, very nice, and the location is perfect. One of my favorite areas in New York by far. Highly recommended and would definitely book again."
3348,888089,2021-12-01,"I can’t say enough great things about the hosts and this stay. The location is really close to the M and L trains, making getting to Manhattan and other parts of Brooklyn very easy. The hosts were so kind and helpful, helping me move my things up the stairs. The stairs aren’t bad at all, it’s two flights. The cat they have is very friendly and tolerated (even played with my dog) and they made my NYC transition very easy."
3349,598000,2019-09-15,Great location and host!
3350,678891,2019-07-26,Would not suggest booking in the Summer because of the heat but great place to stay and very close to the city! Lots of restaurants nearby. Quick responses from the host as well.
3351,652037,2019-01-19,"AMAZING experience! The place was clean, great location, great neighbourhood, lots of stores in the area, and Annie is amazing! She added personal touches around her place and was always easy to get ahold of if I ever had any questions! I will definitely be coming back!"
3352,534046,2019-06-09,"Great location, Great host"
3353,287878,2019-04-15,Our stay was great here at Fernando’s. Everything was very clean and was so comfortable after long days of touristing. The area was great and right by Central Park and the subway which made our stay much more enjoyable. He was her responsive and check-in was a breeze.
3354,554869,2019-03-27,"Good value. Well located. Very small. It's a good place if you only need a bed and a bathroom. Don't expect to cook anything in the efficiency kitchen. We had a hard time using the hot plate and the microwave. Refrigerator works well. Walls are thin and easy to hear other occupants in the adjoining room. Bathroom is super small and not the most up to date. If it's just a quick trip, no big deal, but don't plan to stay here for a week. I would stay again for a night or two."
3355,593840,2019-10-08,Great place. A few block from shopping centers and subways. Bigger then expected. Close to the airport. Great place
3356,853799,2021-04-27,Amazing stay beautiful views and beautiful hotel! Price is super generous
3357,696858,2020-12-04,Small really good very clean
3358,487098,2019-04-21,"This space was perfect, the location, the hosts, everything. It made our trip to NYC that much more enjoyable. It was nice not having to rely on buying food all of the time. <br/><br/>There was some snacks and drinks in the apartment already for us and they even made up the couch bed. Their communication is great! <br/><br/>It is on the third floor and the steps are kind of steep so keep that in mind while booking. The subway is about two blocks away and it takes about twenty minutes to get to Manhattan. <br/><br/>Overall great place, would definitely recommend!"
3359,562154,2019-09-22,"Exactly how the pictures explains it , cozy , calm place great location ."
3360,451500,2021-09-10,Ania was kind and chill. Made check-in/out super easy. Nice space in great neighborhood.
3361,38291,2019-05-02,what a lovely family house! I've spent 8 nights and i felt like visiting grand parents home. Joseph family is very friendly :) there are 3 metro stations and nice cafes around house in 10min. hopefully visit again! <br/>가족이 사는 집이지만 개인실과 개인욕실을 사용해서 불편한 점이 없었습니다. 집도 예쁘게 잘 꾸며져있고 다들 친절해서 지내는 동안 좋았어요! 맨해튼에 주로 다닐 예정이라면 이동시간을 고려해야하지만 가격을 생각하면 괜찮은 옵션일 수 있습니다:) 짐이 많은 편이라면 살짝 좁을 수는 있습니다
3362,575144,2019-04-07,"Pema was incredibly accommodating and an excellent host. I felt very welcomed. The place was larger than I expected as it is a well-finished, long spacious loft with wifi and tv set-top box for streaming."
3363,784817,2020-09-14,I give it 5 stars.
3364,851227,2021-08-04,"My boyfriend and I stayed at JT’s place for a month when we were in NYC, and we absolutely loved our time there. <br/><br/>The best aspect was the location—nestled in the heart of LES, you’ll be steps away from some of the best restaurants the city has to offer, a 5 minute walk to the subway, and walking distance to SoHo and Chinatown. It was so easy to get to anywhere we needed to go. The streets are dirtier and more crowded than other areas of Manhattan, but you’re in LES so what do you expect. But despite being in such a busy neighborhood, we had no problem at all with noise because the apartment windows face a courtyard and not the streets. <br/><br/>The apartment itself is a bit small but very “New York-esque.” It came with most things that we needed for a long-term stay (e.g., AC, heater, TV, kitchen utensils, iron) and the remaining items we were able to pick up at the Trader Joe’s and Target that was nearby. It was very clean upon arrival.<br/><br/>Overall, we would highly recommend JT’s place, especially if you’re optimizing for a central location."
3365,282498,2019-11-03,Beautiful house. Easy to check in and out. Highly recommended
3366,675264,2020-03-01,"Melitza’s hospitality started from the moment she confirmed our stay. The place was clean, cute and close to the airport. Melitza checked in with us during our stay to make sure everything was up to our standards and was readily available if we needed anything. Thank you Melitza for surpassing every expectation!"
3367,573172,2019-04-28,Everything ok as described
3368,479216,2019-08-15,"Clean space, easy commute to & from Manhattan. Shared bathroom but apart from that it’s great value for money."
3369,734024,2020-02-16,"Fabio and Angies place was sparkling clean, nicely appointed, huge ! The beds are so comfortable my family did not want to get up. They checked on us after the first night to make sure all was to our liking. Very thoughtful. Location is two minutes from subway . Two minute walk to store. Very quiet at night. There is one short flight of stairs to enter. But not a real issue <br/>We would definitely come back"
3370,713928,2020-03-11,"a little disappointed with our stay. as soon as we got to the apartment we noticed that our bedroom had a weird smell that we couldn’t get to go away. also, expect to take a cold shower during your stay!"
3371,646016,2021-10-25,"Fantastic hosts, beautiful apartment. Would stay again. Thank you!"
3372,694007,2019-05-13,"My stay at Xavier's place was very comfortable. The place is very clean and tidy, and the room is indeed spacious with lots of natural light. Checking in was easy and there are many stores and interesting shops nearby. Would definitely stay again."
3373,493973,2019-03-07,"Juan is one of the best Airbnb hosts I’ve ever had—kind, easygoing, welcoming, and prompt in his responses. I consider Juan’s place to be a home away from home and would happily stay here again."
3374,789550,2020-11-06,I appreciate a host felt well at home thank you Chrissy!
3375,796807,2021-02-09,"Ampere is the best host you can imagine. Always accommodating, social, and he even served Asian food for me on numerous occasions during my month-long stay here. The room facing the street is a gem of a work space as well with three windows surrounding you so you're facing the action down both sides of the street. Kitchen and bathroom were always clean and everything in order. Lastly, you feel like a co-resident here rather than just a guest and people generally stay for longer periods here. Highly recommend Ampere's place as a quiet place to get work done or as a peaceful platform from which to explore the city via Forest station just a block away."
3376,257472,2019-05-13,"Laura is a very nice host, helpful, has great tips for local eateries and bars and was super responsive. I would not hesitate to recommend!"
3377,674186,2020-01-27,Place was great. It was clean and quiet.  Would stay again.
3378,108600,2019-07-27,"We stayed in this apartment for the entire month of July and were very comfortable. Communication with Light was excellent during our stay. We only needed to touch base with him a couple of times but he responded quickly when we did and he was always very kind. The location is wonderful if you want to feel like you are in the middle of everything (restaurants, clubs, parks, transportation). The subway is a 2 minute walk from the apartment and almost every important line runs through the station. You can get anywhere in Manhattan, Brooklyn, Queens, or Harlem very easily.  The apartment is a walk up without elevator but once inside it is very comfortable with air conditioning, big windows, ceiling fans in every room and two bathrooms. Living room has a large sitting area and large screen projection system, separate dining room with full size table, and a queen size bed with good storage in the bedroom.  The apartment had all of the necessities that we required and we were very happy with our stay."
3379,243038,2019-03-29,"We had a great stay. Fast response, clean, great neighborhood, good communications and nearby parks for kids! Warmly recommend Christianas place. :)"
3380,171060,2019-12-15,"This place was as described.  The subway was a quick walk away and super easy to use to navigate around the city.  We didn’t use the kitchen space other than the fridge, but it would’ve been nice if we needed it.  Tom was responsive to any questions before the stay and during the stay."
3381,796517,2021-06-18,Great stay I loved the location . The view is very nice . Very quite & peaceful . Thanks I’ll love to book again
3382,277680,2019-10-18,"Everything was perfect! Apartment as it’s shown in the pictures, clean and Tom was great and very helpful at check out! Easy access to public transport to get to town - recommended 100%!"
3383,678258,2021-05-06,"Mary's place was wonderful. The space is big, two main rooms, a bathroom and a bedroom. There are TVs in the main room and bedroom, a cute little kitchen, plenty of space to work if you are doing a work-remote trip, and the location is IDEAL. If you love Park Slope (and I do), the location can't be beat. Mary was very communicative and thoughtful as well. Would definitely stay here again!"
3384,327520,2021-07-01,"Great stay, helpful staff, good amount of space. Good price quality."
3385,826315,2020-09-24,"Good place, recommend everyone!!!"
3386,454107,2019-03-26,"Anthony’s place was perfect for our needs, highly recommended."
3387,697464,2020-03-01,The place is great and in a great location. Finding parking was a challenge but overall we are satisfied with our experience.
3388,815155,2021-08-17,It was great stay at Felix. The host is absolutely nice. The place is a good to stay and clean. I would highly recommend this place.
3389,687175,2020-08-20,Very roomy & comfortable. I recommend this beautiful home.The host was amazing and had a very fast response 
3390,882514,2021-09-30,Wenday was very easy to communicate with and the room was exactly what we needed for a quick stop over from JFK.
3391,793040,2021-03-08,"Fue fácil llegar al lugar, el cuarto estaba super limpio y los anfitriones son súper amables. Las respuestas siempre fueron rápidas. Definitivamente lo recomiendo."
3392,838945,2020-12-03,"Ubicación espectacular! Depto impecable, súper recomendado!"
3393,840647,2021-10-04,"I had a wonderful stay at Marcellos place. Everything was clean and the apartment was very spacious! The bed was incredibly comfortable and the front patio was a lovely added treat for morning coffee or an evening glass of wine. As if it couldn’t get better, there is a Dedicated offstreet parking space and the downstairs tenants are lovely. The two young boys even gave me a piece of pizza when I arrived. I couldn’t recommend this listing  more, if you were looking to stay in the Bronx, look no further."
3394,519587,2019-05-27,Great stay! Location was perfect!
3395,571524,2020-02-13,"Myles deserves the super host designation! I give Myles and his apartment 5 out of 5 stars: Fantastic! Myles truly has his guests in a “home away from home”. When the concept of Airbnb came along, it was the novel idea that travelers could have more than a square box with a bed, when away from home. A lot of hosts have missed the point, but this is not the case in the fully furnished apartment that Myles provides. Superbly decorated, with very tasteful amenities that anyone would have in their own dwelling. Attention to detail was most certainly on his mind when he planned out how he wanted his guests to feel in his house. Beautiful wooden floors, with floor to ceiling tile in both the kitchen and bathroom. And speaking of the bathroom, it’s beyond nice with chrome faucets, plenty of towels and soaps and just about every other hygiene product someone might need. In the full sized kitchen, there was every type of tea and coffee for the Keurig machine, complete with four person serving sets. The beds were super comfortable with lots of pillows and blankets. Everything was very clean and well maintained which let me know that Myles really cared about his place. I most certainly recommend this place to everyone who plans on spending some time in NYC!"
3396,823575,2021-11-27,Great place would definitely book again
3397,887974,2021-09-19,Lovely management!!! A great place to stay in the area for the price!
3398,691410,2019-07-16,"Très belle chambre, le lit est top, tout est super clean et très bien décoré. Yamid est géniale, pleine de petites attentions et très réactives dès qu'on a une question ! L'emplacement est super, proche de l'aéroport de La Guardia (15min en voiture mais il y a aussi  une navette) et ligne de métro à 5 min à pied ! J'y reviendrais avec grand plaisir lors de mon prochain voyage à NY "
3399,829020,2021-07-23,Everything was perfect thank you so much <br/>100% recommended <br/><br/>❤️

3402,84621,2021-08-29,"Stefan's the best Airbnb host I've had. Wonderful guy, great communicator, fair, clean, and kind. His apartment is absolutely stunning and is an excellent space. If you have the opportunity to stay in his apartment, I can't recommend it enough. Thanks Stefan!"
3403,492454,2019-08-26,"Todo excelente, sin duda vamos a volver! Ubicación perfecta, el departamento es increíble, gran tamaño, limpio y Dasha y Charles súper cordiales!! Gracias!!!!"
3404,13658,2021-07-25,"great place, very friendly and helpful host!  the space is the space is nice and clean. I do not recommend taking a car because it is complicated, if you do, the best option is to take it to a parking lot to avoid fines."
3405,232371,2019-04-21,"Loyda is a wonderful host, and her place is in a marvelous area convenient to everything.  I really enjoyed this stay"
3406,864674,2021-08-31,Horrible experience. The host let me know a day before my arrival that this space was not even available. When I tried to get a refund for their mistake the host ghosted me and blocked me and is making it so that I cannot get my money back. Awful experience DO NOT book with this host
3407,485468,2019-04-19,"Wir waren zu viert in dem Appartement, 2 Kinder u 2 Erwachsene.<br/>Die Umgebung war sicher, das Appartement war sauber. Gute Verkehrsanbindung nach Manhattan, sowie gute Einkaufsmöglichkeiten und Restaurants in der Nähe.<br/>Für uns war es die perfekte Unterkunft. <br/>Der Schlüssel wurde in einem 24h Shop hinterlegt, so dass es auch kein Problem war, dass wir erst um 2 Uhr morgens angekommen sind. Alles war sehr unkompliziert."
3408,886508,2021-10-26,I really enjoyed my stay.<br/>This space is a gem in Brooklyn.<br/>My top reviewed places as seen on my travel blog. Thank you ladies for making my birthday special.
3409,663283,2020-08-03,Miao’s place offers a peaceful studio apartment in an urban area. I highly recommend his AirBnB to anyone planning to stay in the Brooklyn Area

3412,264575,2019-05-07,"Laura is an excellent host and communicated with us really well and promptly. The apartment is cozy and comfortable. The bus takes you pretty close to it, its maybe 45min from manhattan. We never met our (Hidden by Airbnb) and it was pretty private and lovely. Many thanks to Laura who made check in and check out so simple and easy!"
3413,853350,2021-04-20,Lindsay’s place was perfect for a stay in the city! The apartment was so cute and extremely clean. Her responses were quick and thoughtful and I really think the guide she gives you before checking in was an amazing touch! Very helpful for a guest if they’re not familiar with the area at all. Parking was easy enough to find in the neighborhood and there’s so many great restaurants within walking distance. I would definitely stay here again :)
3414,815089,2021-12-01,"Great location and easy check-in. Clean place and easy access to lower and midtown Manhattan. <br/>Short on some amenities (toilet paper, soap); few other amenities mentioned were missing (shampoo, conditioner). The host was reachable, but took >24h to respond to some queries, which was not ideal."
3415,784202,2020-06-19,"It was a nice, clean looking place! Very easy to get to. The check in process was seamless."
3416,213045,2019-07-28,"Perfect location for my annual Curl Fest event. The room was clean, provided lots of storage and the bed was comfy. Roger was in constant communication and attentive to my needs. I would stay here again."
3417,376122,2021-10-06,"This place more than met our expectations. It was quiet and very spacious. The bed was amazingly comfy as was all the furniture in the living room. Every need was met in the kitchen and the bathroom. We loved the location so close to the park, markets, and all transportation (bus and Subway). Gerald offered prompt and good advice. We liked 2 nearby restaurants: Alison and Terenga Ethiopian.  Be sure and check out the Conservatory Gardens nearby in the park, 3 types of gardens with the amazing Vanderbilt Gate."
3418,384090,2021-11-01,Carla was a perfect host. The location was convenient and the apartment was very cute and clean. I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a spot to stay in the city.
3419,744213,2019-06-08,"We had a great stay at this place.  I think we may have been the host's first guests so there were some kinks but the host was so responsive in sorting them out they didn't impact our overall experience.  The location is super convenient.  Other than regular New York street noise, it was quiet and comfortable.  The A/C was good and not too noisy.  The location is so convenient for getting around to the rest of the city, lots of affordable places to eat for take-out or delivery or get groceries to eat in.  Be sure to try Joe's Pizza on Fulton, a new downtown outpost of popular Greenwich Village spot."
3420,871888,2021-11-14,"This is a beautiful AirBnB. It’s super clean, thoughtfully decorated, well organized & set up with everything you might need from glassware & pots to cook with. The bed is comfortable and the living room is perfect for daytime lounging. I love the design touches and quality visual environment. It was raining so we couldn’t hang outside but we took advantage of the pool table downstairs, so that was a bonus!"
3421,845040,2021-06-08,"My family and I just got back from several days at Erin and Eli’s spot in Brooklyn. I will start with the pros. This place is perfect if you have a small child and/or pets. We have a 21 month old and the toys were awesome and the backyard was great for our dogs. Both were ideal for entertaining especially since it was extraordinarily hot while we were there. The location is great as we were able to access everything we wanted in Brooklyn and also it’s not too far from Manhattan should you wish to venture into the city. Everything was well stocked and we had plenty of space.<br/><br/>The one major con which bumped their review down from five stars was that when I booked our trip, my three major criteria were that pets were allowed, there was Wi-Fi, and that there was air-conditioning, especially as I am six months pregnant and as I mentioned we have a toddler.  <br/><br/>Upon arrival, the house was rather toasty and I reached out to find out how we could adjust the air temperature since air conditioning was listed as an amenity as I had taken screenshots of the amenities before arriving.  After further inquiry with the host, they informed me that there was no air conditioning available at the time as the units were in storage and I noticed then that the air conditioning was no longer listed as an amenity. I felt extremely awkward and not sure what to do since the forecast called for high 80s/90s and traveling with a toddler and being pregnant I knew we could not stay there given the hot conditions.  After a brief back-and-forth with Airbnb customer service and Erin and Eli, they agreed to put in the window units and we were able to get AC by that same day late afternoon."
3422,329620,2019-04-06,"I would definitely stay here again~ it was affordable, the staff was courteous, and it was CLEAN and well-staffed!"
3423,827160,2020-11-24,"It was a very peaceful, relaxing and clean environment. Access to transportation and services was a plus. Communication and booking process was on point."
3424,741565,2019-08-06,"El alojamiento es de primera, muy bien ubicado, cerca de la estación de metro y de bus, tiene varios servicios al rededor del lugar y con mucha seguridad"
3425,423489,2021-02-16,"A wonderful little studio with all the necessary amenities.  Great natural light and a comfortable bed.  Easy access to groceries and subway lines.  No problems with heating --stayed during snow storm and was very cozy.  Minor improvements and better isolation from neighbors  (smells and noise) would be nice, but not expected at this price point.  Walter was a thoughtful and responsive host."
3426,830711,2021-07-31,"Thank you for a welcoming stay! Jo was super easy to reach when I had trouble getting to the apartment and explained the directions in a clear manner.

3429,714379,2021-11-06,"Everything was great, as informed in the description and pictures, so no surprises. It is in total 5 flights of stairs, so it is something to consider especially when dealing with big bags. Other than that, communication was great, the apartment was clean and the location is great because Chinatown is full of opportunities and you'll be in the heart of it."
3430,730495,2019-05-23,Place was super clean and neat and the room is much spacier than expected. The host is very hospitable and responsive to each request. Will definitely come back if the opportunity presents itself.

3437,714589,2019-08-18,"WOW! This was my first time using Airbnb and Annie really left an amazing impression!  The pictures do not do this place any justice! The moment I walked into her place I immediately felt at home! The decorating was amazing! Her responsiveness was so quick I thought we were texting instead of using a website to communicate. I can't honestly say what the best part of staying here was: Everything from start to finish went so nice and smooth!  Check in/out was a breeze. She checked in on us to see how we were doing, she gave us an awesome NYC pizza recommendation, she even had a laundromat card on the table for us to use. The thoughtful notes and touches were a bonus! Location was great for what I needed. I could go on and on but then this review would be so long most people wouldn't read its entirety! <br/><br/>Hands down FANTASTIC place and host! Highly recommended and I know my next visit to NYC  I'm going to see if Annie's place is available first!!!!"

Great food options like Ruddy & Deans and other local Mexican and Thai food options. Grocery is walking distance. The inside was comfortable and really gives you the chance to spread out. VERY CLEAN.

3459,595226,2020-01-17,Wonderful Place. Genuine person. Ready to help out and a good person to be with. Much more to him than his lovable nature.
3460,596813,2019-05-14,"Хорошее месторасположение с учетом стоимости жилья. Рядом есть магазины, метро, в доме - прачечная.  В квартире чисто, хозяин не беспокоит, с горячей водой все ок. Чисто, есть кухня, где можно готовить."
3461,720875,2019-06-26,"Amazing- Wonderful- Awesome-Outstanding- Perfect- Lovely!  Everything you need and want, trust me, you’ll be impressed!! <br/><br/>I was traveling with my 14 year old daughter. We had never been to NY so not knowing the area there were some concerns I had because well, we were 2 females traveling alone. We were in town to attend my oldest daughters high school graduation. While in town we enjoyed the city and many of the tourist attractions. <br/><br/>I am so thankful I found this place! I couldn’t have asked for a better host. Hands down the best experience I have ever had! The host, Javier and his wife Cynthia are delightful people. They truly care and go the extra mile to make your stay amazing. Their place felt like home away from home! <br/><br/>When we arrived we had fresh fruit, some snacks, drinks in the fridge, 2 brand new loofas in the shower, just to name a few things. Seriously there was nothing they didn’t think of. Their place was perfect and sparkling clean. I will definitely stay here when I visit NY again."
3462,294505,2020-10-24,Very good place to stay

3466,325218,2019-03-24,"Just had a great three night stay with Felix and family.  Very engaging and interesting man who offered great advice on local neighborhood activities.  The accommodation itself was comfortable, we had all the basic necessities.  We had access to the kitchen but it’s New York, of course, so we were eating out and sampling the city cuisine.  This place is very convenient—it’s about a three minute walk to the commercial district of Flatbush Ave where many restaurants are.  The nearest subway station is also there and, for me (being a mountain boy), perhaps the best feature was the relative  peace and quiet of Prospect Park where I could get in a good morning run and just enjoy calmness in the midst of all the hustle and bustle. All in all, this place is an excellent value."
3467,806349,2020-10-20,Nice place to stay
3468,867641,2021-08-01,Very easy check in and great location! Nice small hotel room!
3469,678120,2019-09-22,"Hereby we would like to thank you again for the great accommodation and the kindness of Molly & Justin. Quick response to our messages, also personalized conversations between us. We can only recommend them.<br/><br/>My wife and I cooked a lot. The kitchen is well equipped, everything you need to make a good steak are available, and more than. The view from the upstairs to the peaceful green area was very pleasing. Subway F is 10-15 minutes' walk from Manhattan. We went for walks every day to F subway. I think it's a great and quiet area.<br/><br/>We hope to see you again and get back to them.<br/>Whit kind Regards,<br/>Bence & Szilvi"
3470,499404,2019-11-04,Staying at Karen’s place was fantastic. The room was spacious and at the same time very comfortable and the location is great since it’s right next to the Metro so can take you in the city very quickly. Felt very safe at the Neighbourhood even when returning late and Karen herself was a lovey Host
3471,834005,2020-11-28,"Dino was super responsive, check-in was easy, the location is GREAT!, and the place was super clean (important during this time) and very private. He was also flexible when I needed to check in a little earlier."
3472,653294,2019-03-20,Second bedroom is through the first which isn’t necessarily bad but there is a shared bathroom which may interrupt the one person.
3473,652944,2019-08-14,A friendly and free experience.  The host is amazing
3474,681406,2021-08-11,I love everything about Mike's place. One thing I love very much about is that the neighborhood is safe. I would recommend this place to my friends and family

3485,833996,2021-08-29,Great place to crash for the evening!
3486,592902,2021-08-26,"I had a very nice stay here and would have stayed longer if I'd had the time. The location is very close to the subway (7 train), just a few minute walk. I was in town to see a couple baseball games at CitiField, which is only 2 stops away. You can also take the 7 into Manhattan with stops at Grand Central and Times Square. The self check-in was easy to follow and my room was spacious and clean. I found the bed very comfortable and was so glad to have an air conditioner in my room as it was over 90° outside during my stay. The kitchen is small, but nice. I only needed to use the microwave, but there is everything you would need if you wanted to cook. The fridge had plenty of space to store my food in. My room was the first one when you enter the apartment so it was the farthest from the bathrooms, but that wasn't a problem for me. I only saw a couple of the other guests briefly and I never had to wait to get into the bathroom. If you're coming by car like I did, street parking is free but it can be hard to find a parking spot so you'll likely have to circle the block quite a few times. The window in the room faces the street so you can hear noises from outside, but overall I found it pretty quiet. I can recommend this place and would definitely stay here again."
3487,699346,2020-02-28,It has been a very good experience.
3488,826976,2021-09-21,The place is really nice and close to everything. Subway is just 2m walk. The room is really big and even big enough for three guests. Neighborhood around there is really nice. Stores and restaurants are easy to find.
3489,703519,2021-08-21,fine for overnight stay near Citi Field.
3490,624185,2019-03-14,"They room is like in the photos, clean and comfortable room. J is a great host. I would definitely recommend this place."
3491,862401,2021-10-19,"This place is even cuter than advertised! Great for the price and everything was very organized, clean and tidy. Beautiful natural light coming in through the many windows and a well equipped kitchen. Check in and out was a complete breeze. We definitely want to stay here again :)"
3492,862271,2021-08-28,"We had an excellent NY experience.  Zev is friendly, helpful, communicative and a great host.  The place is simple, clean, well appointed and had everything we needed for a weekend stay.  The location is amazing and the views of the Manhattan skyline are spectacular.  The apartment is spacious and was just right for our party of 4.  We could walk to some Brooklyn neighborhood  spots for drinks and coffee/tea. We had a very memorable trip and  appreciate Zev's hospitality."
3493,779523,2021-05-17,"Great apartment in Ridgewood.  Very easy to grab the train and get around, in four days we covered 30 miles on foot… It was crazy.  So many cute little pubs and eatery in the neighborhood. The bed was super comfy… We will be back"
3494,692226,2019-12-04,"I stayed in a private bedroom at Lakshmee's house and it was perfect for my needs. Super close to JFK airport, very accurate and simple check-in instructions to find the home and enter. I was very impressed by how clean everything was and I slept very well. I will definitely be coming back if I have flights in or out of JFK that warrant sleeping near the airport. Thanks for a great place to stay, Lakshmee!"
3495,768079,2021-10-22,I was bitten by bed bugs six times at this location and I’m working paranoid I brought them with me home or even in my cars I’ve been going nuts.
3496,534408,2020-08-30,The room is nice and clean. I love when Adeyemi responded quickly to my texts and gave suggestions for places to roam around in our 2-day trip. He even searched and sent me the link for the cruise to liberty statue.<br/>Can’t be happier and will recommend this room to everyone
3497,619004,2021-10-17,"Great location, clean space, responsive host."

3500,833980,2020-11-29,"Unit was pretty clean and building is pretty nice. However, cleaners arrived before I was due tk checkout. Roku TV is unable to connect to internet about 50% of the time. Although host was responsive in trying to troubleshoot, the issue persisted."
3501,886657,2021-09-20,"Definitely recommend, everything was accurate and Check in was smooth"

3504,811969,2021-01-04,"It has an incredible location, public transport and restaurants close by!  It's the best of all :) It is a space for only two people although the shared bathroom was what I did not like so much!  Yuki answers messages quickly and very kind :)"
3505,552572,2019-11-02,Diana was one of the nicest hosts that we've had. She made us feel welcomed the very first time we met. Her place was quite convenient being near the MR train station and some places to buy food from. We are grateful that she made a little adjustment when we bought our dog with us. Thanks for being a great host Diana. You deserve your badge being a superhost here. We definitely would book your place again next time. Highly recommended!
3506,616839,2019-03-25,"Nice place, stylishly done and perfect for a long weekend. Super location in Brooklyn."
3507,819554,2020-10-05,"Sonia's space is definitely one of the best I have visited, every time I am in Queens NY it will be my preferred place, it is very clean and quiet, I love it."
3508,474741,2021-08-19,The place is ~10 minutes via car from JFK. It was as described. The host was very accomodating and let me check-in after 12am (my flight was late).
3509,508354,2020-04-25,Great experience! Check in very easy with clear directions. Very comfy room and common spaces. I was there for a long stay and every day the home was kept squeaky clean. I highly recommend this place.
3510,686439,2019-05-09,"The Comfy Heaven is an excellent place to stay in NYC. All the appliances in the apartment work well, and it's extremely well located in NY, near the Dakota and the 42th subway station. The French press, to make coffee, was new to us, but very easy to manage. Next year hope to come back !"
3511,831679,2020-10-22,.
3512,616682,2021-03-10,We had a lil miss communication about the use of the back yard but other than that Had a nice quiet time during my stay here. Thank you for the amazing hospitality.
3513,755773,2019-09-21,Great place
3514,737064,2019-12-14,Distance to the airport was great
3515,250588,2020-11-28,"Chris's place was very clean, cozy, and comfortable. The check-in and check-out process was very easy. The space was small, but Chris did a great job at making the place cozy and welcoming. Chris was also very responsive and kind. The bed was very comfortable and there was a heater to keep us warm which was great! Chris provided bagels, English muffins, and cream cheese along with water bottles which was very kind of him. The location was fantastic - it made the place very worthwhile. Only a five minute walk to the Subway! Although it wasn't the fanciest, Chris's place was perfect for what I was looking for - a place for two students to stay for their short trip to NYC. I would definitely recommend to other student-travelers or to those looking for an affordable place to stay in the Lower East Side. My only small complaints are that it would be nice to have a table/coffee table of some sorts and the walls are a bit thin so you can hear people in the hallway occasionally. However, neither of these things interfered drastically with my stay. Thank you Chris for being a fantastic host!"
3516,41866,2019-08-01,"The apartment is nice and cozy. It is well equipped with a washing machine and a dryer. Also, there is air-conditioning in the bedroom. The apartment is located in a nice, quiet neighbourhood bustling with bars and restaurants. Everything is accessible. There’s actually a key food supermarket nearby and a metro station that links to Manhattan. Andrew was out of town during our stay. We mostly communicated via -email but whenever we contacted him over some issues concerning the apartment he treated us with kindness and respect. However, there were a few things about the apartment that perturbed and puzzled us. For example, there was a leak in the kitchen, which caused us strain on heavy rainy days. We also spotted some cockroaches and bugs crawling on the carpet and the couch. The house-keeper, however, quickly took care of it by applying insecticides in every corner of the apartment. The thing that disturbed us the most was finding rat droppings in the bed. There was a crack in one of the bedroom walls through which the rat came in and out. Andrew sent somebody to fix the wall but we could still hear chewing and scratching sounds in the walls."
3517,748736,2020-02-08,The place is nice and has a lot of design and art details. There is a bar downstairs so you can take a cocktail or have some lunch easy. Just consider some noise as the apartment is in the corner of a main avenue.
3518,805755,2020-10-14,Outstanding place and very respectful host!
3519,419123,2019-09-16,"Wir waren insgesamt zwei Wochen als Gäste bei Ricardo. <br/>Die Kommunikation im Voraus klappte problemlos und es war sehr angenehm, dass wir trotz Flugverspätung noch entspannt einchecken konnten. Bei unsere Ankunft war das Zimmer sauber und den Bildern entsprechend. Die Wohnanlage/der Gebäudekomplex erschien uns in der ganzen Zeit sehr sicher und aufgeräumt. Die Nachbarn, die wir in der Zeit getroffen haben, waren sehr nett und wir haben uns in Harlem nie unsicher gefühlt. <br/>Am ersten Morgen fiel uns auf, dass das Bad leider nicht ganz so sauber war und nicht unseren Erwartungen entsprach. Dort ist auf jeden Fall noch Luft nach oben. Auch kam es uns etwas merkwürdig vor, dass wir als Gäste (natürlich) hinter uns aufräumen sollten, aber hätten uns das an manchen Stellen auch in der Küche vom Gastgeber gewünscht (z.B. Geschirr in der Spüle). <br/>Wie bereits in anderen Bewertungen zu lesen können wir uns anschließen, dass es nachts teilweise durch die Nachbarn lauter ist. Allerdings kann man trotzdem gut schlafen, wenn man müde vom Sightseeing ist. <br/>In der Zeit waren mehrere Shootings in der Wohnung (wie in der Anzeige beschrieben), die Leute waren immer nett und wir haben uns nicht gestört gefühlt. <br/>Bei Problemen konnten wir uns immer gut an Ricardo wenden und es wurde eine Lösung gesucht und gefunden. Insgesamt war er sehr gastfreundlich und hat sich immer wieder nach unserem Befinden erkundigt. <br/>Auch der Check-Out verlief ohne Komplikationen.<br/><br/>Insgesamt können wir die Wohnung empfehlen, da man eigentlich eh den gesamten Tag nur unterwegs ist und abends erst wiederkehrt. Im Sommer kann es im Zimmer relativ warm werden, aber die AC hilft gut bei diesem Problem, ist aber etwas lauter."
3520,731809,2019-12-10,"Clean, close to the R train, easy check-in, fast responses from Kevin!"
3521,470577,2019-07-13,"I visited NYC to catch up with friends and do some rehearsals with the musicians for my wedding. This was a great space for both - easy access to lots of public transit to get everywhere, and a nice rehearsal space with piano for practicing ceremony/reception pieces. Everyone’s favorite are the wonderful photos and prior show flyers surrounding the rehearsal space, a lovely reminder of the deep history of the place. Thank you!"
3522,739677,2020-02-22,"Es gab tolle Restauranttipps und nette Gespräche mit den Gastgebern. Das Zimmer ist schön eingerichtet, die Wohnung in einer tollen Lage. New York hat viel Spaß gemacht mit dieser Unterkunftsmöglichkeit!"
3523,35221,2019-05-08,"Nothing but praises for Carmel’s place: very spacious and comfortable; at a perfect location, close to many bus and metro routes; and a walking distance to the main Harlem and Upper West Side points of interest. In all respects, it’s a five-star accommodation."
3524,395695,2019-02-17,"Eventho we didnt have chance to meet, Kristen helped me a lot for to keep me comfortable. If you’re an animal lover, she has a beautiful cat. And it was a good communication too"

3527,797202,2021-09-19,"Yuan is so kind to open her sweet apartment within walking distance of Broadway and the bus station (a dream for those who take the bus to see Broadway shows from Massachusetts) to strangers like us. We stayed for one glorious night. The room is totally comfortable. The shower is hot. You can get everywhere in minutes. My husband and I really appreciated the spacious room, air conditioning, a nice, soft bed, and all the pretty plants. We never saw Yuan again after we checked in…there was so much privacy. We felt safe, and incredibly grateful to be in NYC for the first time since 2019 as the world comes back to life. Thank you, Yuan."
3528,446070,2021-09-03,We had an awesome stay!  Super comfortable apartment (including working remotely) and convenient location to subway.  Anthony was awesome to work with throughout the stay. Would love to visit again!
3529,499790,2019-04-28,Place was clean. Location is a bit far from downtown (~1 hour via transit). Shampoo was not provided and check in process was a little unclear. Bed was okay. Didn't totally agree with the comments about most comfortable beds ever. Shower is via wand only. Above head does not work.
3530,430894,2019-08-04,It was great! But I saw cockroach
3531,834771,2020-11-29,For a quick bnb. It was cute and stylish and spacious enough for five people. Truly appreciate the last minute mix up I had and the host helped out immediately. Overall great stay.
3532,693799,2019-09-24,"Dave's place is in a perfect spot - easy to find, ample parking (if you remember to pay attention to street cleaning signs), close to any and all forms of transportation, and full of things to do in the neighborhood. Check-in was easy, the place is what to expect in a Brooklyn apartment right down to the super dark (and quiet) basement bedroom. Dave gets bonus points for being the quickest and most responsive host we've stayed with - while we didn't meet personally, he was on the ball with anything we had questions about."
3533,787154,2020-02-06,Love this place very quiet and enough space just to relax when you’re traveling!! Would definitely stay here again!!
3534,426691,2019-11-20,This cozy little corner of Brooklyn is very clean and the hosts are very quick to answer any questions! Definitely got my daily leg workout climbing those 3 flights of stairs. Very close to the F and R subway lines to get where you need to go!
3535,385486,2019-11-16,"Sharon is a lovely host and was helpful coming down for check in and through our visit. <br/>The wifi could have used a boost and the location was about 35-40 minutes to midtown, also be aware there is an additional guest fee. <br/>The apartment was very comfortable and the neighbourhood was nice and quiet. The bathroom and whole apartment were clean and well maintained. <br/>Overall we had a good stay in the Bronx and had an excellent visit to New York! <br/>Thanks Sharon!"
3536,676098,2019-01-03,"This is nice little place if you are looking for a peaceful stay. Whole ambience emphasises being calm, quiet and by yourself. I liked the vibes here. <br/>It’s not a fancy place but if you are a solo traveler who likes to meet kind folks and is fully okay for being by himself, I think this could be a good place."
3537,383631,2019-10-31,"Petra was a wonderful and responsive host. The location was perfect - close to cafes, public transport, and the park. The place was very spacious and secure, with an amazing backyard! Highly recommend and would definitely stay again."
3538,404339,2020-10-11,Had an excellent time. Great accommodations!
3539,675288,2019-05-13,Chantelle is a great host. She was very hospitable.   Check in was easy. Elevator in building is great. Place was clean and quiet. Hard to find a quiet apartment in NYC. Great value. <br/>A few small things was noted to Chantelle that can take the apart from good to great.
3540,732629,2019-08-26,"Everything was almost perfect at Yehudit’s place. Only complaint I would have is to probably list the place as a room and not an apartment. Also place doesn’t have an iron, which kind of sucked because the clothes became wrinkled from being rolled up in a suitcase for so long. Other than that, the place was EXTREMELY clean and peaceful. A few noise from kids playing, but that didn’t bother me at all because it’s New York and I wasn’t planning to be in the Airbnb 95% of the time anyways."
3541,718257,2019-11-16,"Very clean room, kitchen and comfortable bedding. Overall, I would stay again."
3542,876657,2021-11-17,"Great location, super clean kitchen and bathroom areas, also Lida is very responsive and easy to communicate with!"
3543,354160,2019-01-21,Good option if you need a well-located place for one person. Room is small so it’s convenient for someone looking to spend time all day outside and comeback to sleep.<br/>Window couldn’t be completely shut (it was letting air in) but John left me a heater which helped during the cold night.
3544,397720,2021-06-11,Very esay to comunicate with. The place has everything you would need. It is very close to a metro station and has a lot of places near by to buy food and groceries. The hosts are great!
3545,577507,2021-02-28,"Daniel is superbly responsive and hospitable. I can’t give him enough credit for his efforts.<br/><br/>The apartment has plenty of pots, pans, and utensils that allow you to cook for yourself, and there’s a sweet coffee set-up with multiple pour-over options and a temp-controlled kettle. <br/><br/>Bed is comfortable albeit extremely firm. The apartment is on a quiet-enough street, but the upstairs neighbors’ staircase is directly above the bed. Their early mornings can easily become your early mornings (though their is a white noise machine and plenty of disposable earplugs to help!).<br/><br/>Overall, apartment is clean, safe, and livable with an attentive host!"
3546,578603,2019-06-23,It’s the perfect place where to stay in New York for a weekend of  without spending a fortune. Very close to the metro and nice area close to the river.
3547,236810,2019-04-15,Poppy was a great host and was very accommodating.
3548,872926,2021-08-22,Matthew is a very good person! He is always in touch and very polite. The apartment is wonderful. The location of the apartment is excellent. Highly recommend!
3549,849864,2021-05-03,easy checkin very clean
3550,695394,2019-08-01,Small rooms but great for the price
3551,844706,2021-09-16,What an awesome place to stay if you want to walk to time square or go see Broadway that’s just opened back up! Lots of yummy places right underneath you on restaurant row. You can grab a citi bike around the corner and explore. But the most amazing thing is how incredibly quiet it was! Clean spacious and has everything you need to make you feel like a real New Yorker
3552,571704,2020-12-30,Nice and clean
3553,63000,2020-04-06,"Mélanie is a beautiful person. <br/>The apartment is really clean, confortable and have a good location. The subway is near to the apartment and there are a lot of good place for eat around this place. <br/>I advisable this place."
3554,333146,2021-08-22,"Excelente servicio, limpieza y comunicación, los perros Mía y Enzo son un amor  al igual que la anfritiona. Volveremos en diciembre y definitivamente este será nuestro lugar. Gracias por tan excelente servicio , nos sentimos como en nuestra casa . El apartamento extremadamente limpio. 100% recomendado ❤❤❤❤❤"
3555,843758,2021-05-25,Very easy booking process! Did not encounter any problems and great location! Will stay here again!
3556,809299,2020-03-08,We really enjoyed our stay here. Very peaceful and great attention from our host when we needed anything. We are grateful and will definitely stay again soon.
3557,592861,2019-05-05,"I stayed here for 2 nights while visiting NYC and I liked this place. Everything was clean and neat. Also it is really ~3min from subway station and there are a lot of places to eat or buy food nearby. Eduardo, Kimberly and John were responding very quickly and always helped when I had questions."
3558,258695,2020-03-01,"This was my first time AirBnBing and it was so easy and very nice to have a ""homelike"" space.  Michael is super responsive, the apartment is warm, super clean and in a convenient spot.  Check in was easy, and I couldn't be more pleased."
3559,715928,2021-08-12,A very lovely home in a quiet neighborhood. The host provided plenty of water and clean dishes because there was no kitchen sink.  Would stay again!!
3560,753961,2019-09-28,Nice place to stay but was disappointed by being given the wrong code on entry - made for a frustrating check in. Not something you need after a long flight
3561,218847,2020-01-08,Check in was so quick and simple and the place was great can't ask for better!
3562,506865,2019-09-02,Good Stay
3563,582176,2019-09-30,"The value of this apartment is great! Sleeping 6 in such a convenient location to Manhattan is amazing! 3 subway stations very close by that can get you anywhere you want to go, supermarket a few blocks away, and a fully functional independent apartment in Queens. All of the rooms, except kitchen have air conditioning, which is essential as it can get warm during the day. Great! And having Netflix was a perk! HOWEVER, I would definitely not say it’s sparking clean. Everything was tidy but the carpet (especially in the living room) has stains and is very well worn, the place could use a fresh coat of paint in more than one place and the bathtub grout has mold stains. The beds in the 2 bedrooms are comfortable but the extra fold out futons in living room are lopsided and need leveling to be comfortable. The upstairs neighbors were nice but noisy until very late at night almost every night (past midnight) and there is construction on either side of the building making lots of noise. If you’re staying during the week, beware (but they don’t start before 8am)! Check in was easy and convenient with the key code and Barbara was kind and responsive to messages. The convenience of location almost makes up for the downfalls but not quite. I think next time I would try to find a better place by booking even earlier."
3564,846291,2021-11-01,"Victoria’s place was beautiful, clean, and spacious. It was right off the subway and there were tons of great places to eat, drink, and be merry nearby. I’d definitely recommend staying here."
3565,249279,2021-08-09,Leonarda was a great host. She provided anything we could have needed. The location was great. We got to be close to Columbia and only a quick subway ride from the city. You can catch the subway just a couple blocks from the apartment it was super convenient. It’s a great price for a nice place in New York. I would definitely stay again.
3566,339692,2019-05-17,"very nice place , we loved it.<br/>And Louise is really friendy!!!"
3567,309576,2021-08-04,"This was my first AirBnB stay, and Chris set the bar high for my future stay with other hosts. The apartment was clean, well furnished, quiet neighborhood w/ good amenities, and I appreciate how responsive my host was. Looking forward to staying here again on my future visits to NYC."
3568,688174,2019-01-08,First time in New York I wasn’t sure if this would be located central to everything but it was easily accessible I Uber’d for the most part it was inexpensive.  Check in/ check out was easy the room is clean the beds were comfortable it had a fridge and microwave. The hallways are older and have a distinct smell but our room smelled fine and was close to the elevator. Overall great affordable stay!
3569,703103,2019-06-24,"The place was really nice, safe and quiet and the bus stop is nearby if you want to go somewhere. Thank you, Modesta"
3570,783649,2020-01-16,Great location in Midtown Manhattan
3571,692230,2019-12-10,"Awesome gem near JFK. I had overnight layover from Vietnam so I was exhausted. Lakshmee’s place was perfect. I stayed in room 1 and it was clean, simple yet stylish. Had a restful night. Great local tips. Lakshmee is such a friendly delightful host I will definitely stay again."
3572,870818,2021-11-01,Good value for what you get.

3574,790462,2020-09-25,"Amazing location, sparkling clean and great space for a group trip to NYC. The beds were very comfy! A little noisy at night as the bedrooms are right by the road, but you get used to it - would definitely stay again!"
3575,838485,2021-05-02,Dave was very welcoming and im in gratitude of the opportunity he has provided me with. <br/><br/>Thank you Dave
3576,876099,2021-10-18,"This place is in a great location of Manhattan, a couple blocks away from the museum, Central Park, fine dining restaurants, and nightlife places. Francisco is polite and helpful. The room is surprisingly very quiet despite belong located in a vibrant area. I highly recommend staying here anytime you visit Manhattan. I award 5 stars."
3577,396996,2019-07-06,The Interfaith Retreat was a welcoming spot with many amenities. If you’re looking for a reasonably priced place where you’re not trying to spend to much time in beside sleeping this is the place. Do note the beds aren’t made for tall people (I’m 6’3)  and consist of a about 6” of cushion. Everyone there was very kind and respectful.
3578,108063,2020-01-02,"Our stay at Liz place was nothing short of fantastic! It was a lovely, cozy brownstone in a great location in Brooklyn. Liz was a terrific host all around; great communication and correspondence, accomodating (she accommodated my request for an early check-in), and great hospitality. Liz's mother ended up being the person who got us settled in and she gave us a pleasant check-in experience along with some great recommendations for food and ""must see"" spots. Just a great experience overall for me and my son and I hope to stay again in the future."
3579,827511,2021-07-14,Great location
3580,516079,2020-11-20,A+ highly recommend it
3581,141044,2019-04-20,"Vi var 3 voksne som boede i lejligheden i 9 dage. Vi havde et soveværelse med en god dobbeltseng og en sove sofa i stuen/køkkenet. Lejligheden ligger i stueplan i et Brooklyn brownstone hus. Vi havde Ca 10 minutters gang til nærmeste Subway linje A eller C kører til Manhattan på under 20 minutter. I kvarteret er der flere små og gode spise steder. Især Peaches som ligger 200 meter væk laver fantastisk fried chicken, fried catfish og fried shrimps. Må virkelig anbefales. Rhonda er en rigtig god vært. Vi snakkede mange gange med hende om mange ting og han gav os ideer til ting vi kunne se eller prøve i New York. Vi vender meget tilbage til både Rhonda og New York."
3582,490347,2019-08-17,Seryn’s place was very comfortable for my family during our time in Brooklyn. The space was as described and there were thoughtful touches throughout the home. It was a kid friendly place with bunk beds and toys for my kids to play with. Check in and check out was very easy.  We would stay here again. Thanks!
3583,757260,2019-09-19,A great place to stay! Marlowe was a very welcoming host and super helpful when it came to navigating the city! Place was very clean and easy to check in and out of. Would stay here again if I'm ever in the city!
3584,166416,2020-11-12,This place was very cozy and comfortable
3585,537867,2019-11-21,"Nick was an excellent host and the place felt very comfortable as well. It's also in a great location, a block away from the subway so it's easy to get around. Plenty of stuff within walking distance as well in the neighborhood. I'd definitely recommend this!"
3586,290553,2019-05-01,The apartment is very warm and cozy. we felt at home there. And everything was there that we needed. Also two metro stations in the area with a good connection to the center of Manhatten.<br/>There is a double bed. but also a single folding bed. We were three people. It was also quiet in the area at night too. It is a beautiful old house with many wooden floors. So sometimes you hear something but we did not find it disturbing. We enjoyed this cozy airb & b.
3587,402746,2019-11-10,"El apartamento de Gladys es tal y como se ve en las fotos. Para dos persona es ideal, tiene una pequeña cocina equipada con todo lo necesario, el baño pequeño también pero bien resuelto, las toallas blancas y súper gustosas! Y el dormitorio muy cómodo y tranquilo. La única cosa que nos resultó un poco incómoda fue la mesa alta, al estilo bar, que queda muy chic pero para mi es incómoda. Por lo demás tiene un supermercado y varias tiendas a un minuto de casa así como el bus. Para coger el metro hay que andar unos diez minutos pero el paseo por el barrio es agradable. La verdad es que hemos estado muy a gusto! <br/>Gladys fue muy amable siempre respondiendo a nuestros consultas y nos permitió dejar las maletas durante el día de nuestra vuelta ya que el vuelo salía a última hora, lo que nos permitió disfrutar del día con total comodidad y tranquilidad."
3588,852963,2021-04-01,Great location and unbeatable price! 100% recommended.
3589,481587,2020-01-31,Great place great location
3590,886273,2021-11-30,Great place
3591,537046,2019-02-14,"The room is undeniably tiny... but it's also $20 a night in Manhattan, with actual walls and closing doors. You simply cannot beat the price. Friendly and accommodating host, too. Highly recommended if you're traveling solo on a budget."
3592,618279,2020-03-15,"Will definitely be back! Safe location, very clean, felt like home sweet home!"
3593,733606,2021-08-15,"The place is great for a short stay. Was close to a bodega, the subway, and cafes. Jackie is friendly and a kind host!"
3594,853443,2021-08-15,Third time's the charm.  I absolutely enjoyed my stay once again at Aqeel's home.  So grateful for his hospitality and the extra goodies he left for me in the fridge.   Hope to be back soon!
3595,707064,2019-03-12,"The apartment was very nice and newly renovated.  Although the water in the bathroom shower was not hot enough, we did enjoy our stay."
3596,420372,2019-03-24,Great place and location!
3597,154618,2019-09-18,I booked last minute because previous plans fell through and Mercedes was quick to respond and help me book her place. Her space was perfect. The bed was extra comfortable and felt like my bed at home. She had the best conditioner and shampoo too — she thinks of the little things that make a difference when you’re on the road working. I would stay here again!
3598,666841,2019-12-16,Un lugar muy comodo y limpio y tan solo a una cuadra del metro. Ibamos 4 personas y fue perfecto. <br/>Volveriamos de nuevo!
3599,744675,2021-08-27,"Wow! An’s place was even better in person and totally worth it. The view was breathtaking, an unobstructed view to an orchestra of skyscrapers. Located in a nice quiet neighborhood full of character, it’s just a short walk away from Times Square and Central Park. There’s a bike-rental station down the street so be sure to rent one out and take a ride on the nearby Hudson River bike trail. Thanks An for a truly unforgettable stay!"
3600,505607,2021-06-29,"I can highly recommend this apartment, and I want to give the reasons why this place stand out, especially compared to other similarly-priced ""entire home"" - apartments in NYC. <br/>(1) Andy is a particularly helpful and generous host. I don't want to set a precedent for people to refer to by being too specific about this. Generally, you can expect to be treated nicely. That's not a given in NYC.<br/>(2) This is a legitimate full, private, regular apartment which the guest can use while Andy is not around. There exist other acceptable places in NYC, but often those are converted basements, more or less well separated and incomplete subsections of the host's house etc. Not here! Depending on your requirements you might have to be sure to live in a specific and regular apartment while in NYC.<br/>(3) If you want to experience Astoria, this is a great place to be. There is a subway station close by, and lots of restaurants, bars, shops etc.<br/>(4) Some reviewers point out that this is not the newest and most modern house. Yes, it is true that this is more like the home of a person who is visibly enjoying NYC and Astoria for some years and not a newly built place. However, it is fine, clean (I didn't witness any infestation) and fully functional with character (e.g. there is a collection of CDs and VHS tapes)."
3601,853943,2021-10-01,This place is truly amazing and offers everything you need for a great New York visit. Perfectly close to public transportation in a quiet street. <br/>The place itself is perfectly equipped and everything is in super good shape. The kitchen is a true pleasure for cooks. <br/>Highly recommended!
3602,699672,2021-02-07,"Kimesha’s place was clean, organized and smelled so nice. She was also thoughtful with the stuff she left us at her place. Although we didn’t meet in person she was very considerate on giving us our privacy but I thought that it was kind of her for giving us the option to meet her or not. She definitely responded fast and left great details on our arrival. I would definitely recommend going to her place."
3603,739358,2020-07-01,"Amazing in-the-cut space! Very private, and accommodates two people perfectly. The host is amazing and she responded to us so quickly and helped us with anything we needed! Will definitely favorite this place !"
3604,371392,2019-07-25,"Outstanding host and venue, do not hesitate, ENJOY!"
3605,854954,2021-07-28,✅ Very accurate photos<br/><br/>✅ memory foam bed and comfortable pillows<br/><br/>✅ Amazing water pressure and hot water<br/><br/>✅ great deck<br/><br/>✅ Modern style<br/><br/>✅ easy check in<br/><br/>✅ very responsive and txts you periodically to make sure your stay is going well<br/><br/> Free and Easy Parking<br/><br/>I would definitely stay here a again.  Don’t pay attention to the photos on (Hidden by Airbnb) maps it’s inaccurate.
3606,431827,2021-11-14,Great location. Apartment was spacious and comfortable for our group.

3611,577949,2019-06-13,We had a lovely stay with Bianca in Manhattan. She was an extremely accommodating host allowing us to drop off our bags early on a rainy day and providing us with two umbrellas to get out and enjoy the city despite the rainy weather. Her place was very comfortable and we had access to a private bathroom. The space was extremely clean and had great style. This was the perfect place for us to enjoy NYC and was close to public transportation. We would definitely stay there again!
3612,754334,2019-11-23,"Situated in the perfect area if you are going to the Javits Center or anything around there. It is a bit small, really just room to shower and sleep. So if you aren’t looking to hangout in the room and just need a place to stay overnight than this would work for you."
3613,402009,2019-09-13,"Aleksandra was such a great host and her son was wonderful. We had great conversations, she had delicious coffee for me every morning and the room was very clean."
3614,783626,2020-05-17,"I rented a room for 2 months. One of the window blinds fell off on the first day and it was never fixed. The microwave is installed in the bathroom which felt really unhygienic. Packages delivered to the apartment were reportedly missing. Due to COVID, my flights were getting cancelled. I requested for an extension of 2 days and they were quick to agree and charged me money for it. My newly-booked flight got cancelled again and I requested to cancel the extension and asked for a refund the next day, and Sharedeasy completely dismissed my request based on their “30-day notice” policy. It felt very unfair for the company to do so, given that they made an exception to the 30-day policy when I requested for an extension and happily took my money, but when I asked to cancel that extension and a refund within less than 24 hours of paying for it, they said no. Note that this was at least 3 weeks ahead of the move-out date, so it is not by any means a last-minute notice from my end. On top of all the stress of living through a pandemic away from home, this felt like a very unfair response from the company’s management."
3615,398277,2020-08-31,Great one bedroom apartment. Kitchen and bathroom had everything you'll need to feel at home. Privacy and nice entrance area. Very responsive.
3616,783568,2019-11-17,"Rohi’s place was great! It was very close to the metro so it was fairly easy to get around the city. The apartment was clean, tidy, and Rohi provided us with towels and some water in the room we were staying in. He was even nice enough to let us check in early and leave our stuff later on our check out day so we could spend the day exploring the city without hauling around our luggage! Definitely a great place to stay!"
3617,274046,2021-03-27,Great host
3618,743392,2019-10-01,"Everything was good except for PRIVACY.<br/><br/>Be careful, privacy there is a big problem.<br/>Any is a professional including having CAMERAS(!) record everything. <br/>Cameras in the elevator is ok. <br/>Cameras in the living room is NOT ok. <br/>He knew the time I returned at night and the time I left in the morning “I saw it in the cameras” he told me smiling...from that moment, I avoided being home and chose to spent more time out to avoid being watched !<br/><br/>Apart from that, to be fair, Any was very responsive, communication was very good and he changed the door lock when the lock stopped opening with the key.<br/><br/>Bottomline: I’m not sure if exchanging my PRIVACY for staying in a PAID room worths it.<br/>If you are ok with being watched 24/7 in your house, then it worths it."
3619,858289,2021-06-20,Great place to stay. Clean and quiet. Junior is very accommodating  and always made himself available when needed. Thoroughly enjoyed this stay. Highly recommended
3620,315103,2020-03-16,We stayed in Janelle's apartment for 4 nights. It was a great space for 3 adults. One on the sofa bed and 1 in each bedroom. The living space is small if you were to stay inside much. The subway was so close and close to some really nice bars and restaurants! We never met Janelle. We were let in by someone else and left the keys when leaving.
3621,767451,2021-10-06,"This home was close to everything. Eating, stores and busses within a half block. Very nice neighborhood and the hosts are great!"

3625,400826,2019-02-03,"Nice little apartment, host is upstairs and is available for help anytime! Area has no parking so if you are planning of going out and coming back late, take a uber and leave your car parked! <br/><br/>Thanks Fernando & Wife, really appreciated!"
3626,49697,2019-08-31,Simply perfect!
3627,732479,2021-07-25,"Nice area and very cozy. Everything was within walking distance. First time in Staten,  definitely won't be my last"
3628,173848,2019-01-13,I had a great time and Brian and Arlette were great hosts and able to answer all of my questions. I would definitely recommend their place to anyone who’s looking to explore Brooklyn and the rest of NYC!
3629,651448,2019-10-28,"Comfortable place, Great host, and great location. Will definitely stay again!"
3630,834676,2021-02-12,Spacious Airbnb in a super central location. One block from the Empire State Building and very close to KTown. Everything is walking distance. Comes with essentials like coffee and towels. No television so keep that in mind! I would definitely stay here again and recommend this AirBnB. Terrific value. Thanks Vlad!
3631,419114,2019-02-24,They are so kind and friendly.<br/>Nice atmosphere and good location.<br/>There’s nothing to worry about.<br/>I miss Harlem so much!<br/>Thank you very much.<br/><br/>聞いていたﾊｰﾚﾑよりも治安は良く､人もﾌﾗﾝｸで大家さんであるRicardoさんと彼の奥さんはとてもﾌﾚﾝﾄﾞﾘｰだし居心地が良かったです。日によって向かいのﾋﾞﾙから騒音がして耳栓で凌いでましたが､毎日じゃないです。ﾛｹｰｼｮﾝは125stの地下鉄駅が徒歩5分であり､deliやcafeも1分歩けばあります。ﾄﾞﾗｯｸﾞｽﾄｱやｽｰﾊﾟｰﾏｰｹｯﾄも徒歩距離なので生活は困りません。ﾊﾞｰもﾚｽﾄﾗﾝも繁華街もあり､10分歩けば3ﾄﾞﾙや7ﾄﾞﾙで買える服屋があったりと便利でした<br/>ｺｲﾝﾗﾝﾄﾞﾘｰが地下にあり､6つの機械のうち3つ壊れてましたが特に支障なしです。結構､ﾘﾋﾞﾝｸﾞに彼や彼の同僚や友達など､人が訪れるので孤独感など無く私は好きでした
3632,860200,2021-08-05,Stavros and his place in Prospect Park were both amazing! The apartment was clean and had mostly everything we needed for our month long stay. The location is perfect and the neighborhood is very nice with lots of restaurants and metro access. Stavros was very helpful and whenever we needed something he was attentive and immediately able to help.
3633,501449,2021-06-06,"This is a great place, which is very clean, close to the subways, and grocery stores, etc. The kitchen is provided with necessary utensils and supplies. One could easily shop for some groceries nearby and cook simple meals when needed. To stay here, one needs to be aware of the noise from the park across the street, the intersection nearby, and the ice cream truck during the summer time, especially during the weekends. The owner is very responsive to the guests with any issues within the apartment. <br/>The building has washing machine and cloth dryer which are in the basement."
3634,136360,2019-04-14,"Amazing place! +1 for colour organized book shelves! And +5 for cute dog upon check in<br/><br/>Clinton hill is a great area, easy subway access, good bagel shop down the street, etc"
3635,826661,2021-05-12,"The location is in a very ethnically-diverse neighborhood, so you can eat from a couple of “countries” and It is 1 1/2 blocks from the train station (F/G). The room itself was very clean and was the perfect size for a  1-2 night stay. The mattress way too firm for me, but may be perfect for others. There was a shared kitchen (I didn’t need to utilize it) and be aware that there are tenants living upstairs (so you will hear them). This is a very basic rental. Keep that in mind so that you don’t judge it differently. No check in problems and host was very nice (even providing a space heater because it was a little chilly)."

3637,784633,2021-07-04,It was great
3638,711514,2021-08-28,We loved staying here! Lauren went above and beyond to make us feel comfortable. The beach was so close and the local shops were amazing. She gave great recommendations as to where to go and what to do.
3639,443614,2019-01-30,Affordable place to stay at. Close too many things. Before you book make sure you read their reviews thoroughly.
3640,630153,2019-03-27,"What you can expect here is an awesome location in the heart of the city that is convenient to everything in NYC! And a great value. My wife and I had a 4 day/night vacation stay at Judah’s place and we spent our days walking and training around to explore from Chinatown to the far reaches of Brooklyn to the cool restaurants and bars and stores that are right outside the door here. While the apt. is not “sparkling 5 star hotel shiny” it is clean & comfortable and has everything you need to rest and recharge between days of NYC exploring. The price is more than fair for the location and Judah was super responsive and knowledgeable whenever we reached out with a question.   Check in procedures were clear.  All around, great experience. Thank you,"
3641,349390,2020-11-14,"Pros: Great location, very clean, quiet and safe neighborhood, super comfortable king sized bed, good access to public transit and lots of shops/restaurants nearby within walking distance, plenty of cooking equipment if needed. Hosts were very responsive and communicative.<br/><br/>Cons: Low ceiling height. I am 6'1"" and had to duck almost the entire time I was walking through the space, and there's a transition into the bedroom where if I didn't remember to duck even more I would hit my head, which I did several times, unfortunately. If you're tall, since this is a basement unit, this may be a bit uncomfortable. Also, the upstairs neighbors can get a bit loud at times; during the week we could hear people walking around upstairs and talking past 1am. Neither of these things can really be changed by the host, but probably just worth noting. If you bring some earplugs for sleeping that should help a lot."
3642,749973,2019-11-15,No Heat at night<br/>not clean and very Noisy On the main road
3643,679869,2019-03-16,Nice location and a great space to stay!
3644,750239,2019-11-11,"From a simple message inquiry Davica was friendly and very informative. She responds very quickly to all queries...The pics  of the  place are the same in person. OuR rooom was nice and clean was equipped with towels,  deodorant ,  mini soap and toothbrush/toothpaste  and had a tv in rooom... love the living room area ,kitchen and bathroom,  very clean... Check  in was easy as well. We were greeted by her mom who was really friendly and helpful throughout  our  stay.<br/> Upon arrival there are refreshments on the table was so nice of them.  Commute was easy.  Train  station just a minute or 2 minutes away from her house.  Popeyes, Burger King  across the road and other minimarts.  Shopping  areas close by as wel,l i was always in pretty girl or rainbow. And lets not forget was just 15 mins away from airport jfk...  Loved my stay from beginning to end .Would recommend  to anyone and id stay here again."
3645,538688,2019-03-19,"Amazing place, super cute! The bed was comfortable but made a noise everytime we moved, which wasn’t a big deal. I loved everything about this place except for the fact that you can’t cook in their kitchen( you can keep stuff in the fridge), which meant we had to leave to eat out every meal, which was ok because we were on vacation, but costed a lot for our stay."
3646,380298,2019-10-17,"Clean, but small and basic. A chair and some sort of nightstand in the room would have been nice. Bathroom faucet dripped all the time and the door handles coming into the hall were an issue, loose and the key wouldn't come back out of the middle door handle."
3647,772927,2019-12-01,Nice. Neat. Exactly what you need
3648,740359,2021-07-12,"C- at best. I booked at the last minute and you get what you pay for. Doable but needs to be updated not just the furniture. The bathroom is so small its impossible to be in there and close the door plus, tiles where falling apart in the shower, which made me not want to shower.. Its a steep basement apartment and the railing is broken. I almost fell down the steps with luggage. It also smells wet. I won't book again. Yes it's clean, so close to the airport (which is why I rented) but you will hear the planes overhead. Host was responsive."
3649,735665,2019-12-09,"The place was great! Backyard was nice and big, the kids could run around and play. Neighborhood had a lot of things to do and it was conveniently located. Place was clean and spacious."
3650,891028,2021-11-14,It was a great stay
3651,702800,2021-10-24,"The Airbnb is located in a prime location in Midtown with subway stations closeby. The apartment size is okay for a 2 bedroom 1 bath and stocked with basic amenities for a fully furnished spot. The space was somewhat dirty when I moved in where towels were not fully cleaned beforehand and there was dust on the floor. <br/><br/>The host was very bad at communicating. After moving in to the place, I had questions about receiving mail and the air conditioner but the host would take days to respond even after sending multiple messages. I tried messaging the host about other concerns but he stopped responding altogether. I stayed at the apartment for over 3 months and was left dealing with most situations on my own.<br/><br/>I would not recommend staying at this place even at the cheap price that I ended up paying at."
3652,817478,2020-10-07,Wendy's place was really comfortable I'd recommended to anyone traveling to that area! She was an excellent host.
3653,818700,2021-05-28,"This was my first time getting an Airbnb and I'm so glad I went with this one.  It was very clean, the rooms had AC and the check-in process was super easy. Overall, I highly recommend staying here."

3661,591092,2021-09-24,"We loved our stay in Brooklyn! Sunny's place really felt like home away from home and was just perfect for my husband and I's first trip to the East Coast. The neighborhood is beautiful and there are plenty of great food options within walking distance. But if you're looking to go a bit further, the Subway is only about a 10 minute walk from the apartment. Sunny was very quick to respond to any questions we had and was super helpful. We will definitely try to stay here again if we make it back to New York in the near future!"

3665,104731,2021-05-10,"This place is different from your usual stays. A refreshing change of pace mixed with great amenities, and an even greater host! Very welcoming and very accommodating. A walk away from many restaurants. A train ride away from the city. A place to be relax, enjoy, and be inspired."

3670,558246,2019-05-28,"This is a shared space, with other tenants or Airbnb users. Good value, not an over the top space. Good place to stay if you have an early flight in the morning - good place if you need something cheap. Asad was great at communicating and was very helpful."

3677,451599,2021-01-03,"I reserved Darryl's space for my mom and sister to stay for 5 weeks in December. They had a great time, and it was a pleasure to be in touch with Darryl. My mom and sister were so comfortable in his apartment, the bed and space were so comfortable, and they loved the location. Darryl was helpful and responsive throughout their stay. The washer/dryer were so convenient, and Darryl keeps the apartment well stocked with cleaning and kitchen supplies. We hope to return soon!"
3678,167660,2019-05-27,"Fernando's place was fantastic. Great for our girls weekend. The room and apartment was clean and tidy, and had everything we needed.

3684,597352,2021-07-25,The stay was excellent and Genae had impeccable communication whenever I needed something. It’s a nice little place in the Bronx. Someone mentioned it being loud before but I hardly experienced much noise.
3685,511384,2019-01-04,Kristyn’s place was clean and cozy. The perfect place for my one day stopover in the city. The location was close to the train and had a parking garage nearby as listed. Kristyn was friendly and flexible with check in and made sure I had everything I needed during my stay.
3686,236831,2019-09-14,Great place in quiet place of brooklyn! I recommend highly!:)

3690,227423,2019-02-11,"A great stay, and Jesse is a great host. We had some trouble with the radiator, and he had his super on it to fix it before we returned from our day out.

3706,568759,2021-06-14,our stay at jamels space was wonderful and looked exactly like the photos. the apartment is situated at the end of a quiet and friendly block in the the little caribbean area oh brooklyn with plenty of room for parking. as west indians ourselves we appreciated having access to familiar foods and resources and plenty of places to shop for essential items. jamel gave us our space and privacy while still being accessible via messages. we requested an extra day and it was approved immediately. we will definitely be staying at jamels apartment again in the near future!
3707,822002,2021-08-07,"The place was not exactly what was expected as far as the bathroom and kitchen, but was a comfortable stay and accessible."
3708,717423,2020-08-11,"Amazing spot. <br/>Very relaxing. <br/>The host was super kind wrote me a letter, provided some wine and my favorite orange juice. <br/>Everything about this place made me not want to leave. The host responded quickly and had no issues at all. I loved the shower set as well."
3709,804774,2021-08-25,"Ok so this place is just as nice as it looks however for me there were a few issues. So to me the only issues I had were the fact that only on the last day was a wifi extender given after several complaints. Also I wish the dog fee was clearer on air Bnb as I thought it was only dogs 25lbs an up that involved a fee so maybe don’t list pets allowed if there’s gonna be a fee regardless, usually when it says pets allowed there’s no fee unless we’re staying at a hotel?? Also didn’t like that it wasn’t listed that we couldn’t flush tp, right when we walked in there was a smell especially when the ac was off and it was very obvious what the smell was from. If you’re going to have that kind of set up, which grosses me out, maybe have a more sanitary trash like the ones ppl use to throw away diapers ‍♂️ maybe then it won’t smell as much. Cause for me and my fiancé it’s one thing that we had to throw our used toilet paper in the trash but it’s something else to smell it… other than that great location nice bed etc the ac could be colder or more than one but the bed was really soft !!!"
3710,377061,2019-03-11,"The apartment is very well equipped, clean, comfortable and located in a great Brooklyn neighborhood.   Dena is a super host, thoughtful and responsive.  We’ll definitely stay here again."

3713,290794,2020-01-27,"The room was exactly as pictured, and the hosts were extremely friendly and responsive. Wi-Fi was somewhat spotty/slow in the bedroom, which did not heavily impact my stay, but may be good to know for someone who would need to get work done/etc. Otherwise, this was a very clean and convenient place to crash for the night!"
3714,801370,2021-05-24,"What an amazing location being so close to everything. The price was phenomenal as was the listing accuracy. My family and I had a great stay. Although the room had one bathroom, on the same floor level there is a communal space where there are more bathrooms and showers (bring flip flops) separated by gender. We felt safe in the area being in a group, and the people at the front desk were friendly and efficient in checking us in and out. There is so much to do in the area with great bars, karaoke and restaurants around. The train station was also close by. Definitely think about booking here!"
3715,884506,2021-11-13,Every thing was clean except the kitchen. They were roaches
3716,805684,2021-05-28,"Overall good stay. The apt is clean with air conditioner and in perfect location to reach Flushing food. Street parking is a bit hard to find at night, but I’ve always found a spot after circling around the neighborhood.<br/><br/>Some problems that made this not a 5 star stay:<br/> - There’s always cigarette smell in the hallway, although the apt itself is supposed to be smoke free, so be aware if you are allergic.<br/> - The fridge was not working during my stay. My ice cream and other take out food was wasted.<br/> - Bathroom light started flashing when I was showering. <br/> - Bed was wabbly."
3717,682967,2019-02-12,"Zahi’s place was great, it was super clean! The apartment was really nice and the bed was very comfy. Close to bars/ restaurants and not too far from Manhattan.. I was driving when I stayed here and found parking to be ok too"
3718,541635,2020-02-20,"Un 10!<br/>Fuimos mi madre y yo e íbamos bastante perdidas.<br/>Antes de hacer la reserva contactamos con Rosalie; que nos contestó al momento nuestras dudas. Hicimos la reserva.<br/>En nuestra llegada, quedamos con Rosalie a las 9pm, pero nos retrasamos debido a las  demoras del chequeo del visado, finalmente llegamos a las 1am, ella nos estuvo esperando en el apartamento para hacernos la entrega de llaves.<br/>El apartamento tiene todos los detallitos para hacerte una estancia muy agradable:<br/>- Ropa de aseo, accesorios de aseo (secador), jabones.<br/>- Productos básicos como sal, azúcar, cafetera, tetera. <br/>- Ropa de cama para poder sustituir, cama grande y cómoda. <br/>- tele por cable/ Wifi.<br/>-Calefacción centralizada para tener el piso temperatura ambiente día/noche, además de un calefactor portátil. <br/>Y un muy buen gusto decorando. <br/><br/>El día de vuelta, que fue ayer, le pedimos si podíamos quedarnos más rato, o un lugar para dejar las maletas,  porque nuestro vuelo salía a las 11pm, nos dijo sin problema, se agradece mucho. <br/><br/>La zona, es Harlem, Un contraste brutal de personas muy distintas, a lo que hay que añadir que hay súper muy cerca de lo más barato que encontramos.<br/><br/>Muy cerca del apartamento hay un club de jazz con las viejas glorias, que tocan estupendamente; Paris Blues, no te cobran por entrar y una birra 5 $.<br/><br/>Todo ha sido excelente, muchas gracias por haber sido participe en un viaje tan mágico. <br/>Jennifer."
3719,180226,2019-11-14,Great location next to Columbia and the 1 line. The rooms and living spaces are very clean and welcoming. Trish is a super hospitable host--great conversation and very accommodating! Highly highly recommend booking this place and I will definitely try to next time I'm in New York!
3720,731320,2019-11-11,The host try charged me extra $10 even though she accepted my request to check out a bit late.
3721,517453,2019-08-08,"Excelente comunicación con Manhattan, buenos servicios alrededor (supermercados, restaurantes). Descripción correcta y detallada."
3722,463717,2019-06-15,"The room is ok. It's a small flat with one room and you will stay in the room while the host sleeps on the couch in the living room. New York is a loud city so I understand that part of outside noise but what really bothered me was the lack of noise consideration from the host. I have been in a lot of Airbnb, and this so far was the worst place where I slept. I didn't rest well, woke up several times with noises such as an elliptical machine and loud phone conversations. The location is really good and she is nice. The check-in could be more efficient. First time I stay in a place that doesn't provide towels. Overall, I didn't hate it but there are so many things the host can improve."
3723,179210,2019-06-22,"This Airbnb was perfect for what I was looking for: a quiet, comfortable, and clean place to stay.  Lola was very courteous.  She offered me tea and we had a lovely chat.  She had everything I needed:  towel, shower, hair dryer, wifi, and full length mirror.  Even a little closet and desk with chair.  There was some street noise overnight, but it was Friday night.  I used to live in NYC and this is a quiet street by Manhattan standards.  Highly recommend!"
3724,695235,2019-11-24,"We couldn't imagine a better first experience with airbnb! Great location, beautiful and comfortable space, so many extra touches that made us feel at home! Lee and Teri were so easy to communicate with both before and during our stay. It was the perfect place for our family to spend the weekend together and we definitely hope to return!"
3725,738976,2019-12-29,Wonderful stay! About 10 mins from the metro station. Very clean apartment and quick responses from Alaa!
3726,613763,2020-07-05,She was very hospitable and quick to respond. Very concerned also about your stay felt as if I had a family member watching over me in a good way. She even  called to remind me that I left one of my possessions behind.
3727,873298,2021-09-07,"This is, by far, the nicest apartment we have lived in since coming to New York every year since 2016. Yekaterina was phenomenal with her accessibility and communications. The building staff were very cordial and the location is super convenient for bus/subway connectivity. We’re coming back!"

I was there for five days to do a bunch of video calls and had everything I needed, except a clothes storage spot, which I recommended they add. The owners are very responsive and available. Recommend!"
3730,722052,2019-07-03,Viktor and his wife are great. So kind and hospitable. I felt so comfortable and safe in their air bnb. We had great communication and I am extremely thankful I was able to stay here.

3732,857977,2021-05-12,The chill spot was perfect for our stay. Carron responded very quickly to all of our needs. Everything went very smoothly and we could definitely stay at the chill spot again in the future.
3733,691279,2021-10-07,"No wonder Flyn is a super host! She was kind enough to check on us throughout our stay. If it's your first time to NYC, she'll give you perfect directions to get to the sights in Manhattan along with awesome recommendations for neighborhood restaurants when you get back to Queens.<br/><br/>Her place has everything you need and is quite comfortable. It's also rare to find a place with a designated parking spot (which is a huge bonus) and for such an affordable price. Highly recommend Flyn's place."
3734,426378,2019-10-05,Staying with Michelle was amazing! The room and bathroom are beautiful and very clean. It was very easy to contact her and she was very helpful  when we needed. <br/>The flat is very well located with a lot of shops around and a Subway station four blocks away so is very easy to go everywhere you want

3744,620543,2019-03-22,"Clint's place was such a great find! It was very spacious and in a great location. Clint was welcoming and accommodating. I would definitely recommend to other travelers. Also, I was worried about NYC parking and it wasn't bad! I got back late each night and I found parking less than a block away from the front door."
3745,809136,2021-10-25,It is superb .. Better for longer term
3746,649323,2019-02-18,Place is very good and functional for a very affordable price. Julie and Tyrone very hospitable as well.

3758,13650,2020-03-11,Amazing! The room and private bathroom are clean and comfortable. Ted is an amazing host. He gave us a lot of advices about subway and restaurants and also prepared a great breakfast every morning. The little kitchen supplies helped a lot. It's super near the subway station and a short 13 minute walk to Central Park. Would definitely stay there again.
3759,226099,2019-02-10,Perfect apartment
3760,817591,2021-08-15,Wendy's place has everything you need for a quiet and pleasant stay. You get a private room with a private bathroom and TV in a house that is shared by other people. Spacious common area if you need to stretch your legs.
3761,734363,2021-10-17,"The attention from the host and specially from senka, the lady who cleans an prepares the apartment was wonderful. She really made us feel at home with her hospitality and warmth. The apartment is okay, spacious, but beads and couch are really uncomfortable. The location is not that great either, but ok. Maybe a bit overpriced, but good experience eitherway!"
3762,553073,2019-08-09,"Excellent location, such a cosy room and the bed is extra comfy! Adam is a excellent helpful host!"

3765,837982,2021-07-19,"Molly was an amazing host! The place was very well maintained, and the location was perfect (right by the L train). She was excellent at keeping communication, and she went beyond most other hosts I've stayed with. We had a few flubs with our trip (flight delays, etc.) and she worked with us flawlessly, despite everything."
3766,740491,2019-06-07,Great place to stay!
3767,407929,2021-08-05,First of all the price is unbeatable for what you're getting. Its exactly as pictured/described. The decor is stunning!! The 3 dogs are literal angels and Zach or Luis where attentive during our stay. I loved it and would definitely come back!!
3768,698448,2019-07-18,房子空间很大，交通也很便利。就是没有空调，非常热，难以入睡
3769,39358,2019-12-11,This is a fantastic place to say - a wonderful space with fantastic service. Highly recommend and would happily stay again
3770,528381,2021-06-16,"Perfect location in UES (10 mins away from Central Park and close to many restaurants & shops). The check-in/check-out process was easy and smooth. We didn't see Melissa around much but she was always available via messages. The private room is not a bedroom, but rather a bed in the living room w/curtain. It did feel a bit cramped, but if you don't have too much luggage and if you're not staying for too long, then it's fine."
3771,315099,2020-02-22,Great location that’s about a 10-15 min subway ride to Times Square! The closest subway stop is a block away which is very convenient and the place was super clean
3772,626161,2019-04-09,"You get what is advertised!  It is an older building, but VERY CLEAN  and THE BEST location. We were there to sleep, shower and get ready in the mornings. It was just what we wanted."
3773,677362,2019-10-24,"Sunny was a fantastic host. His place is very clean and tidy. The location is superb as well.

Overall, it is a lovely place to stay."
3774,836666,2020-12-25,"The place was beautiful , clean and in a good location to get around"
3775,378663,2019-05-22,Ich habe eine Woche mit meiner Tochter in Letitias Wohnung verbracht und wir sind jeden Tag gerne aus  <br/>Manhattan in unsere Unterkunft zurückgekehrt.<br/>Der Begriff ‚blitzsauber’ wird hier völlig zurecht verwendet. <br/>Es gab genügend duftende Handtücher. Die Küchenausstattung ist genau auf 2 Personen abgestimmt und perfekt für die Zubereitung eines Frühstücks oder eines Dinners.<br/>Besonders genossen haben wir unser Essen auf der kleinen Terrasse.<br/>Wir können diese Unterkunft nur weiterempfehlen!!
3776,454918,2021-10-23,A great host and a great property. I enjoyed every moment!
3777,840744,2021-08-26,This was a great bnb and a great home it had everything that we needed. We just had a hard time getting in the building
3778,634739,2021-06-09,"If you’re looking for a super host, Tony is number one. His communication and willingness to accommodate your stay to be as comfortable as possible is amazing. I asked for an iron and a broom, the next day. I had it. Have any questions or concerns, you don’t have to wait long for a response. His place is super clean and cozier than most in the area. The coolest part is the balcony. Tony along with his place Rocks!!"
3779,460609,2019-06-08,"Yngrid and Jiovanni, thanks for being great hosts. As I, too, am a superhost I completely understand why they are too! They were so kind to provide us with a blowup mattress so that we can spread out in the house a little bit more. The place was sparkling clean. We also really liked how Brooklyn the neighborhood was. It seemed like we were locals. There is a wonderful corner store called BK that has great late night food that is cheap. Also, we washed our clothes in a nearby laundry mat. The Internet works great and we are provided with a wonderful guest book that helped us guide our way through the city.<br/><br/>We did have a couple of small issues that did not have anything to do with the host. There were guests upstairs who were extremely loud two nights in a row. This greatly affected our sleep. When I informed the host, we didn’t have any more problems. Also, Please note that this location is not close to the city. If you were looking to hang out in Harlem or in Manhattan this will take it at least an hour every time you want to travel. Each day my family and I spent at least two hours traveling back-and-forth.<br/><br/>We loved the dog Max. He is the friendliest dog ever. We miss him already."
3780,191052,2019-06-07,Had a short but sweet stay at Helens. Loved the neighborhood and suggestions of where to eat :) thanks!

3782,827838,2020-10-30,"Jesús is very kind and welcoming! The apartment is close to plenty of restaurants and stores and the space is very clean and nicely decorated. The AirBnb portion of the apartment is not entirely private, but Jesús was very respectful of our privacy and space while we were there. A great experience for the price!"

3786,253261,2019-02-25,Expect a beautiful clean and comfortable home - with many extra amenities and a pleasant and helpful host who can give you info on how to experience new York and Staten Island . I don’t know how a rental could be any better
3787,759023,2020-03-29,Reasonably priced and clean! Nice host too. Thank you Egbe.
3788,609550,2019-08-25,"Mateo and Gregory are so wonderful at hosting and knowledgeable about the area and happenings in Brooklyn. I definitely felt like I was at home here! Definitely recommend even if just for a short stay, but if you are coming to Brooklyn for a while, stay the whole time! You won’t regret any part of it. They were very responsive/kind/lighthearted folks, the room, bed, and bathroom (well the whole house I’m sure) were sparkling clean, and the location is just fantastic."
3789,742922,2019-12-02,"Tasrinas place was brilliant. Very easy to find between 3 different subway stations-2 are direct from JFK. Very clean, aloud us to drop our bags off early as we arrived in NY in the morning. Very quick at responding to messages. Would 100% stay here again. We loved it. And bonus-very good coffee."
3790,621538,2019-07-15,"We recently stayed at Margaret's home and loved our visit. I thought the space was even nicer than it appeared in the pictures. We loved the area; it is so clean and well kept. The homes in the area are beautiful and surrounded by pretty gardens. Margaret was so friendly and welcoming . She shared suggestions for places to eat and other tips about the neighborhood . We loved he location!!! So convenient to the beach, which was also great...not crowded at all. Restaurants were within walking distance.We loved the private deck off of our space. A nice spot for breakfast and after beach relaxing. Margaret stocked our space with tea and coffee and granola bars. There were books, games, TV, stereo and AC.  A perfect set up for a  relaxing beach weekend! We  definitely plan to return!"
3791,530025,2021-10-01,One of the nicest Airbnb's experience I have ever had. The place is true to description and Jina was very easy to reach out.
3792,778216,2021-07-24,"Clean apartment. Great host.<br/>If I ever come back to nyc, I would stay here for sure."
3793,802501,2020-03-08,"The listing is accurate when it says it's quiet - this beautiful apartment is quieter than my own street in the suburbs! It's close to the park, close to shopping and delicious restaurants... It was honestly just perfect. The doormen had such personalities too - all, around 10/10!We will definitely be coming back."
3794,830425,2021-11-28,"Great location - available street parking, two blocks from subway, restaurants plenty, parks nearby, too many to list! <br/>Tracy is a gracious host giving me plenty of space and making me feel free at her home. She’s also very kind to let me bring the dog even though she had a no pet policy as this was a last min holiday booking. <br/>She’s quick in responding so everything went smoothly. Def recommended!"
3795,751644,2021-04-08,It’s a very tiny place and I would recommend you staying in a hotel in downtown. I expected the entire townhouse to just be me and my quest instead of having neighbors downstairs.
3796,299695,2019-05-19,"Diana's place was insanely comfortable and in a lively and convenient location. Her artsy touches throughout the space were inspirational which adds a nice vibe and character to the house. Diana was very hospitable and thoughtful in how she organizes the kitchen and other shared spaces which makes getting a cup of tea or preparing your breakfast a delight. If you prefer to check out local shops and restaurants, she's full of knowledge on where to go and what to see! I would highly recommend Diana's place! Would definitely stay there again. See you soon Diana!"
3797,748637,2019-10-02,"close to the station, so convinient to go to anywhere"
3798,845110,2021-05-31,"I had the best time staying in Chewie’s homey and cozy room during the Memorial Day weekend. The location is central and convenient, it only takes 10 minutes to walk to either lower east side/Chinatown or Soho. Chewie is so friendly and welcoming that I felt like I was coming back home at the end of each day. This is a great place to stay if you want to explore downtown by foot :)"
3799,746853,2020-10-03,"The place was nice but if the host is going to charge a cleaning fee please clean the location before a new booking is reserved...I would rather not see crumbs/snack wrappers on the floor,someone's personal belongings or hair in the shower or  bathroom and to not have used  dirty sheets on  the bed (even though I brought my own)"
3800,624713,2019-12-16,"A small, cozy studio with everything you need for your stay in NYC! My friend and I were so happy with the location and how easily you could either walk or take the subway downtown to all places you wanna go to. I’ve got no complaints at all!"
3801,611658,2019-01-06,We were delighted to stay at Nina's place

3803,788732,2019-11-10,Hassle free stay due to Michael’s hospitality and communication
3804,180458,2020-05-02,"Laurent was an excellent host who always took extra care and made sure I am ok having in mind that I was there for 3 weeks and at the time when the lockdown in NY started due to COVID. He texted me, asked whether I am ok, came to exchange from a safe distance and both he and his wife were very kind. As they live in the apartment next to the airbnb, they are always available to react immediately on any questions or anything you need. I was feeling really cold the first night and they immediately got me few extra blankets and an extra heater so I was definitely well equipped for an Antarctic winter. Great people!<br/>Location of the flat is excellent, next to the metro and super central in Harlem on walking distance from shops, cool restaurants and bars, also the Apollo Theater  is a 5 min walk. Ask  Laurent, they have a book with all recommended places! <br/>The studio itself is very good as well, perfect if you need a place to stay for sight-seeing or as I was there -to work. I even spent almost a week working from home from there due to COVID which was of course a bit tricky, but it still worked. It has a microwave, a kitchen, a coffee machine, 4 stoves and a little baking oven so you could even have a meal there ( a luxury for NY flats). It is small so I would say a couple plus a small child should be fine there.<br/>Overall, great and thanks so much!"
3805,68015,2021-11-14,"I had an amazing stay with Manon! I was here for an entire month for work and it was great. Manon is extremely hospitable and made sure my stay was as seamless as possible. Great sized room and amenities, awesome location very close to public transit. Definitely cannot recommend this place enough!"
3806,787413,2020-08-19,"Ewa’s place was quiet, calming and relaxing. I would enjoy coming in from a long day, taking a shower, sitting on the bed and staring out the window. So much sunlight - such a calming effect. Spacious and clean, I felt like I was able to shut my mind off for a moment. The neighborhood was great - many options for eating out or grocery shopping. Trains were super close and if you’re looking for some retail therapy, that’s readily available for you nearby. Ewa was very responsive and I never had an issue getting a hold of her. She is thoughtful and caring. Had a great time and wouldn’t hesitate to stay again."
3807,560913,2019-09-10,"Ein bestens ausgestattetes, schönes Appartement. Durch die vielfältigen vorhandenen Lebensmittel im Kühlschrank und in den Küchenschränken war der Start in den Aufenthalt sehr angenehm. Zum Erreichen der Sehenswürdigkeiten in NYC ist Verkehrsanbindung mit Subway und Bus super. <br/>Eine kleine Begebenheit ist jedoch anzumerken: Am Wochenende während unserer 7-Tage-Reise war im Haus des Nachbarn Party bis weit nach Mitternacht angesagt. Ob das nur einmalig war, kann durch die kürze des Aufenthalts nicht beurteilt werden."
3808,466781,2019-06-05,"Affordable, convenient, great for a confident solo traveller."
3809,343394,2021-10-28,Exlente muy atento siempre estuvo con la mejor predisposición!!!!

3811,835878,2021-05-08,"I really loved my stay here! The place was sparkling clean and the rooms are exactly as the pictures show, although I did rearrange one of the smaller rooms that I stayed in. The house comes with really thoughtful kitchenware, including utensils, knives, potato peeler, wine opener, and just about everything that you would need. There is also a lot of storage space. Also, the host was amazing! Inna responded almost immediately whenever I sent a message. Also, when my friends and I faced a problem (clogged drain, etc...) she sent people right away to fix the problem. This listing is also located in an area with a lot of good and affordable local restaurants and groceries! The space and the host were amazing! If you split the rent with three people, it is not too much of a burden. I would recommend this place!"
3812,357099,2019-07-13,"Corporate Housing was above accommodating through out my stay. I had a few hiccups adjusting to a new city and they could not have been more accommodating through out my stay. The studio was clean and equipped with everything you would need to make a stay comfortable. The location is quiet, and convenient to public transportation, in the heart of museum mile,  and steps from Central Park. The location is perfect for work or play in NYC."
3813,730988,2020-01-01,"We had a wonderful trip and enjoyed this gem of a home. Very convenient to subway. More than comfortable for our family of 5 (3 teens).  Very clean. Host offered us coffee that she left in the freezer.  Very hip, stylish and comfortable home!  And the host was very responsive with a couple of questions during our stay.  Thank you!"

3816,712167,2021-10-17,Love the place. Only reason for the 4 star was check-in was later than expected since it still needed to be clean. Other than that great location and value!

3824,265201,2020-03-14,Mr Dor was really nice person and he helped me to carry my baggage when I do check in. His room is prety clean. I would say that I'll stay there again when I go to nyc.
3825,128332,2020-03-26,"Efrain es un excelente anfitrión. Te deja tu espacio personal y solo pide que seas cuidadoso con el lugar, ya que ambos vivirán ahí y hay que ser limpio, al final es tu casa. El lugar es acogedor, limpio, cercano al metro, seguro para entrar, tiene atracciones muy cercanas, como el Apollo Theater y a unos 20/30 minutos caminando está Central Park, también puedes llegar en metro, que está en la puerta misma del departamento. El sistema de entrada es seguro y tú tienes tu propia llave para tu pieza. También hay lugares para comer, que están a un paso y abren hasta tarde. Alrededor anda bastante policía también, así que es muy seguro en cuanto a calidad de vida. Recomendado al 1000%. Si te hospedas aquí, no te vas a arrepentir. Además Efrain te da tips para la ciudad y es muy amable, también tiene un mesón con información para visitar y que hacer en Nueva York. Volveremos, de eso no hay duda. Gracias Efrain!!"
3826,669578,2019-02-03,Topu was a super responsive and great host! Very flexible and accomodating to our needs. It was really nice of him to check in with us during a very cold night to see if we needed any extra blankets or if any cold air was creeping in.<br/><br/>The place was warm enough and cozy. Location was great! Really near the 7 train and a 24hr supermarket. Neighbourhood is very safe as well. Great place for big families to stay with an equipped kitchen to cook a simple meal if needed.
3827,775678,2019-10-26,The host canceled this reservation 4 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
3828,647787,2019-09-22,"Theresa's place was absolutely perfect! Without a doubt, we would ask to stay there again should we have the good fortune of traveling to NYC again.  The beds were the best we ever slept in.  So much that I've asked her the brand and style."
3829,406016,2020-01-05,지하철이나 버스 타기가 좋았어요! 문의 내용은 빠르게 답변주시고 편하게 있다가 왔습니다

3831,643307,2021-06-01,"This place is everything it’s described to be and MUCH more! Extremely peaceful, relaxing and definitely surrounded by West Indian Culture. I stood for Memorial Day weekend so the smells and loud music coming from the surrounding homes  was very comforting and absolutely mouthwatering. PLUS, i was able to find a parking spot every single night; couldn’t be happier. <br/><br/>As per the host, Cando, was extremely responsive, respectful and met my needs within 5-20 minutes. The instructions that he leaves prior to your stay are spot on.  Check in was a breeze and he also accommodated my late check-out with no issues."
3832,336669,2019-03-10,"Great apartment, easy self check in, Lydia was very responsive, amazing host!"

3836,268446,2020-01-24,Great stay.
3837,780118,2019-10-14,I have enjoy so much in this place. Natalia and Daniel are really nice people and were so worried to feel that I was comfortable and happy in every moment. The apartment is located in a perfect area. I will come back again for sure.

3841,661797,2021-10-11,"Freddy's place was great and it is so much bigger in person. Clean, spacious, and in a good location. Freddy was extremely kind and helpful and communicated well."
3842,663438,2019-04-09,"El departamento está buenísimo, tengo sólo cosas buenas para decir.<br/>Bien ubicado, cómoda habitación, muy confortable la cama, tiene netflix que suma un montón!<br/>Estuvimos solo un día pero lo recomendamos!"
3843,384943,2020-10-17,"Great location. Beautiful neighborhood, so close to the park and convenient to everything on the north shore. We were in SI for a wedding at Snug Harbor, and couldn’t have been happier with the location!"

3850,783308,2021-11-16,Such an awesome space. This is my second short stay and it always smells good and is spotless. Kerri responded so quickly and is so accommodating. I am always comfortable and truly feel at home. It's not sterile. Very inviting and homey.
3851,699946,2021-01-01,"Gabrielle’s home is even more incredible  in person, I promise you! The entire home was an experience. I had never stayed in such a beautifully conserved historical property. The mattress is amazing and the bathroom Tub and kitchen appliances were great too. I appreciated the handwritten welcome note. The home was very very clean and you have access to a private garden. What an amazing place to have stayed in and I hope to be back again! Location wise ... a train ride or Uber ride will take you to the city. The train is very close to the home although I didn’t take it. Also, if you’re ordering delivery there are plenty of Options nearby , including a healthy food place that sells the best ginger/lemon/cranberry juice ever. Trust me, you have to stay in this bnb! I also appreciated how invested the owners are in the guests safety. I was reminded to close the front gate which I had accidentally left open. Trust me, the hospitality is superior  and the home is incredible. The shampoo, conditioner and body wash were all high quality ingredients as well."
3852,600168,2019-03-14,"Had a wonderful stay. Apartment is  comfortable, aesthetically pleasing and well located. Ashumi is easy going and very responsive. We highly recommend her place."

3854,395165,2019-11-05,"The space is just as described, it's a nice place to base your New York trip around. It's less than a half a mile to the subway station, and bus line can drop you off even closer. The area in Harlem has a lot of good food and stores locally if you're looking to re-up on some groceries/necessities.<br/><br/>Best part was the tile floors are heated in the bathroom, kitchen, and powder room.   I would stay here again"
3855,630807,2021-05-09,Perfect for my solo trip to NYC. The train was super easy to utilize. Building felt very safe. Plenty of room for my things. Bed was comfy. Gato is a fiesty perk lol.
3856,853010,2021-05-21,"Super clean, super value, easy access to subway and Central Park."
3857,816674,2021-01-01,"Great apartment, pretty spacious with basically 3 places to sleep in, I would honestly live there if I could. Staci replies very quickly and is incredibly nice. The train is a little walk away but you can tough it out. Overall a very nice place to stay at a great price."
3858,608429,2021-09-27,"Diana was such a great host ! They communicated with us very clearly with what to expect during check in which made everything very quick and easy for arrival. Her house is very close to the subway station (about an 8 minute walk) which is extremely convenient !! there are some small stores near by as well as some trendy bars & food spots..We appreciated having the private bathroom and the (almost) private entranceway which is nice because you dont have to disturb the other people in the home if you come in late. There's also a window in the room, I suggest opening because the room may get a little muggy depending on the weather! Overall we had a great stay ! Thanks again"
3859,594478,2019-12-08,Just back from a 4 night stay in Olivias place and what can I say but AMAZING.<br/><br/>The apartment was clean and well stocked of stuff for us to use.<br/><br/>It's an amazing location being only 5mins walk to the nearest subway station and then a 35min train into time square.
3860,641599,2019-06-21,Max is a terrific host. He gave us clear check in instructions and was there to meet us. His place is cozy and comfortable. And it couldn’t be more perfectly located!  We enjoyed our stay there and saw everything we wanted to see during our time in Harlem.
3861,682144,2019-01-12,10/10 would recommend!
3862,336687,2019-07-29,"We had a great time at Lydia's. We liked the neighbourhood and felt safe at night. It was a quick ride into Manhattan (close to two subway lines), and was close to some fun Brooklyn restaurants and bars."
3863,868711,2021-05-27,"Henry was a great host. the room was perfect, even exceeding my expectation. <br/>lovely decorated and comfortable beds. <br/>It will be definitely my first pick for my next trip !!<br/>Thank you for everything !!"
3864,556618,2021-02-11,"Rita would message me from her cell for reasons beyond the scope of a host. She should have had hired someone to shovel snow in the event she could not make it to the house. But at her request I did help out. Only to be monitored as if I was a child.  Upon booking she offered long term options, but at a request of a friend dropping off my mail and not staying overnight made accusations that we could not both fit in a twin bed. And insulted me about my own weight. It was never my intention to have an overnight guest."
3865,861050,2021-06-25,Michael made my stay in New York a pleasant one. The room was in a great location. This is a prefect spot. I highly recommend him
3866,542112,2021-07-15,Great location and great place to stay.  Much roomier that I expected for an apartment in the city.  The multiple window ac units kept all the rooms cool in the humid summer heat.  We would definitely stay here again. Michal was very responsive and helpful.
3867,722120,2019-07-15,"Absolutely fantastic host, one of the best I've had yet. The apartment is very nice and close to good public transport options."
3868,711309,2020-03-16,Great place to stay for real NY experience.
3869,821622,2021-10-27,"had a great stay, communication was great, very accommodating."
3870,538702,2019-06-18,Great place to stay! Definitely recommend
3871,322764,2020-09-25,"Everything is pretty much as described - what you’re seeing is what you’ll get, which is great value at a prime location. I just love the LES/East Village vibe.<br/>Maybe the only slight negative is that the bed is quite squeaky. Just something to know if you care about it, but overall I slept well and felt I was getting great value for my money."
3872,673003,2019-02-18,"This chic private room, bath and kitchenette far exceeded our expectations. It was comfortable, clean and stylish. Our hosts were more than accommodating and communication was prompt and helpful. We would stay again anytime!"
3873,628906,2019-05-31,"Keithan’s apartment is a great value, both for location and hospitality! It was easy to get around Brooklyn and into Manhattan. Also, parking was a breeze! Keithan is very accommodating and helpful as a host."
3874,653670,2019-09-02,5 Star Stay! Our stay with Ronald exceeded all expectations! He was able to accommodate right away after our host went MIA... and we were so glad  in the end. Ron is as friendly and kind as you can find! And his place had literally any and everything you could need including great coffee and quick snacks to take on the road! Will definitely be coming back.
3875,845118,2021-07-01,Nice location if looking for a short stay. Very little communication and  no breakfast as listed tho.
3876,415808,2019-10-12,"It was a great experience staying at Amy’s place, best location and very welcoming hostess. Thank you!"
3877,663275,2020-03-24,"Mia’s place was a much need separation from the present reality we are facing with an epidemic. I was greeted with hospitality, from a safe distance of course, and was provided with everything I needed to enjoy my stay.<br/><br/>The apt was clean and had modern finishes. The artwork displayed throughout was absolutely magnificent. This truly is a rare find."
3878,770721,2020-03-16,Rogers place was clean and peaceful the host was welcoming and thoughtful
3879,522727,2019-01-19,"Stella’s a great host and her place is cozy, clean and in a nice neighborhood. She’s extremely good with communication as well! I will definitely recommend this place to everyone, and come stay with Stella again if I come back in Bronx."
3880,312075,2021-07-26,Loved the room with the attached bathroom! Very private and comfortable. Yemi was very attentive and considerate the entire stay by checking in with us to make sure we were happy. He even left us snacks and drinks! I also loved how close the subway was. Definitely recommend!
3881,886809,2021-10-25,"Carlos' room was what is shown in the pictures, a small room that has access to a (shared) balcony. Carlos's communication was great, and check in super smooth. Also location is great if you want to get to the city fast and I love Saratoga park and cute cafes in the neighborhood. <br/><br/>I think this place is a decent place for a short stop but in my honest opinion $80/night sets up an expectation for a higher standard. I have stayed in rooms in NYC for this price and had more space, privacy and cleanliness. <br/><br/>I think there is inaccuracy to what you pay for and what you get here: the apartment has 4 bedrooms of which 2 had 2 guests when I arrived. The bathroom was quite messy but luckily the next day a cleaner came. The second night someone came in 3am and moved around as if it was 3pm. All this to say: I have stayed in rooms like this in transit and paid around $30-$50 and then known to expect a lot of people sharing the same bathroom and noise in the apartment."
3882,815516,2020-09-20,Very clean and a great space.
3883,630712,2021-10-04,"Very nice secure apartment very close to central park and the subway!  If you are traveling alone at night, as always be very careful and aware of your surroundings."
3884,701485,2019-11-05,Cherry's place in Queens was very spacious for the great value. It was stylish and I would recommend it to anyone coming through the area!
3885,757999,2019-07-24,"Unfortunately I can’t visit Jay, but all time He was in touch attending my needs."
3886,784163,2019-12-20,"Sumeira was an excellent host! The place was very nice, clean, had a good amount of amenities, and was close to a subway! Sumeira went out of her way to make sure our stay was comfortable and wonderful. She gave us lots of tips on getting around the city and even helped us find deals for seeing some broadway shows. I would highly recommend staying at Sumeira’s place!"
3887,873073,2021-10-31,"Nate's apartment was cute, clean and quiet! The location was amazing, and finding street parking was very easy right on Nate's street. Highly recommend!"
3888,872438,2021-08-31,Simple..discreet..private yet breathtaking..perfect location for family or couple relaxtion..great stay overall..host was very helpful..accurate and timely response was excellent..definitely will stay again.
3889,873213,2021-10-19,"Armin is an interior designer by profession, and it shows. Everything in his apartment is tasteful and beautifully designed. The mattress and bed clothes are delicious -- that's the only word for it. The location couldn't be better -- close enough to Times Square to walk to any Broadway show in 10-15 minutes yet far enough away to still have a neighborhood feel. Armin's hospitality was top-notch: I had my privacy but when we met he was always extremely friendly. He even made me one of his Persian dessert specialties! Armin is a people person., and it shows. If you're fortunate enough to be able to book his place, do it!"
3890,744776,2020-12-04,"One of our best stays yet, the host is super cool, and the space is clean, relaxing, and entertaining. You’ll love staying here, and it’s worth every penny!"
3891,752871,2019-10-21,Jesse and Mary are wonderful!  Their place is fantastic.  Great location!  Thank you!!
3892,665457,2019-08-13,His place is very clean and conveniently located. Meir is responsive and it was a pleasure to stay at his home. I highly recommend it.
3893,346252,2019-11-08,Thanks a lot Jonathan! We had a great time in NYC. <br/>We will be back!
3894,546846,2019-10-16,Cannot recommend this place enough. Location is 10/10. Wish we had more time to explore the neighborhood. It’s close to everything. Apartment was sooo comfortable and clean. Such great value. Stay here!!!
3895,321425,2021-09-16,This apt is amazing!! Great location and Cathy was extremely helpful!

3897,775787,2020-01-05,"Great stay! Just a little small in the shower space. We had to find our own parking which luckily wasn’t too hard. Nice decorations and smells good! Clean rooms, little awkward went on a weekend and was told to put the toilet paper in the trash after going to the bathroom.. but everything else was great!!"
3898,502635,2019-10-07,"Evelyns place is in a great part of brooklyn and she is an amazing host. She was so thoughtful, generous, communicative, and genuine. The place is cozy and the backyard is really nice. I will definitely stay there again"
3899,734518,2019-11-09,Room was as described and very clean. Hosts were nice. But the best part was the location. It really can't be beat! Thank you!
3900,304763,2019-07-08,"Raj and Lara were super friendly hosts, the place was super clean, amenities were great, location of the apartment was really good too (a safe and convenient neighbourhood!). I stayed here for 6 weeks and thoroughly enjoyed it. Highly recommended!"
3901,673233,2019-09-28,"Laith place was great. The greatest thing about it is the location, you are one block away from two different subway lines, there’s a Starbucks right outside and a supermarket across de street. The place was spacious and very nicely decorated. Had a great time!"
3902,741340,2021-03-16,The place was very clean and comfortable. The hostess was quick with her responses. I would book again
3903,685253,2019-03-30,This is a great place to stay! It’s MTA accessible and very clean!
3904,177655,2021-08-14,"Great place, lovely area. <br/>Perfect for big groups."
3905,261271,2019-04-28,Excellent stay with a gracious host.
3906,821406,2021-11-14,"Overall it was a pleasant stay. Host was very responsive which was great as there were things that needed fixing throughout my 3-month stay. (WiFi wasn’t working on arrival but fixed within a day.) Some appliances had issues but mostly fixed once reported. <br/><br/>Location was fantastic and the building had great doormen and great mail room guys which made the stay more pleasant. <br/><br/>I enjoyed the stay but would not bill it as luxury, more like adult dorm living. The two bedroom is actually one bedroom/one flex room making the living area dark even during the day.  Holes in the wall from prev tenants banging the door handle too hard and fixtures were quite worn. There is no in-suite laundry and the laundry machines in the building randomly break down as do the elevators, which wasn’t great. However this is not under the host’s control, just something to keep in mind if you plan to stay here."
3907,595123,2020-09-15,Quiet at night
3908,627644,2019-04-06,"Cherisse & Patricia’s place is fabulous, all well-thought and sparkling clean, fresh flowers as well as all necessary amenities were present :)  the host (Cherisse) is very nice person, great hospitality and plenty of local tips on food (restaurants) and places to go (sightseeing, shopping, art watching, parks, etc), and great conversation also, she is available 24/7 and ready to help. The room is very cosy, mattress & sheets (blanket) are beyond comfortable. Cats are also very welcoming still not bothering at all. The building is quiet. The neighborhood is Mexican, safe though. Best tacos. Close to train station (walking), 20-30 minutes to Times Square, 10 minutes to Manhattan, close enough to Brooklyn Bridge (by train). I had wonderful time there and enjoyed staying at Patricia & Cherisse place very much, would definitely recommend staying there to other travelers."
3909,345992,2019-07-06,Our stay at the house was fantastic! We were 2 couples in their thirties and a friend. The house is exactly as described. The deck is particularly enjoyable and the living room is really great to spend time with friends or family. We loved the neighborhood as it packs a punch of great spots and is quieter than the rest of Brooklyn/Manhattan and enjoyed the very convenient commute or proximity to the park.<br/>The abundance of tape and locks on cupboards or doors to avoid guests opening can be a little disturbing but understandable.<br/>Would definitely recommend overall!
3910,288437,2021-08-02,Very nice place to crash after each day out!
3911,798543,2020-02-19,Good spot for solo travellers like me in middle of Manhattan.
3912,646544,2019-11-04,"The apartment is much larger than it appears in the pictures.  There is so much room!  <br/>There is a family that lives upstairs.  They are so nice.  <br/>The home has the basics and nothing more.  It is important to note there is no wifi, television or toiletries provided.  The description says no towels but towels were provided for us.  The kitchen is stocked with pots and pans.  There is no coffee maker.  The hot water in the shower is fantastic!  The bathroom is newly remodeled.  <br/>When I stayed there, it became very cold for me (I'm from Miami).  There was an issue with the boiler/heater.  The family upstairs came a couple of times of try and fix it.  The owner of the home also came.  It worked sometimes.  I contacted the owner and he was able to provided a room space heater for me.  I really appreciated this!!!! <br/>There was an issue with the key.  The front door gate lock gets stuck and once my son had the key so I couldn't get in.  I messaged the host and the family from upstairs opened the door for me.  I really appreciated this too as I had just finished running the NYC marathon and I was exhausted.<br/>I loved the neighborhood.  Great bagel shops, diners, subway stop, RiteAid, banks, movie theater all within walking distance.  <br/>In summary, there were some frustrating things, no coffee maker, wifi or television but the home is very comfortable and I appreciated staying in a home as opposed to a hotel.  The hosts communication is more than ideal.  He is so helpful."
3913,533764,2019-09-23,Location is great. Easy access to the train. No complaints ya. Cool books to read very comfortable bed.
3914,761368,2021-05-16,"Anthony’s place was spotless and the beds and linens very comfortable. Check in could not have been easier. We did not meet our host, but he responded quickly to all communications.<br/><br/>The only thing I would caution future visitors about is that you might want to bring earplugs. The apartment itself was very quiet, but it is very close to the belt parkway. It being a warm night, we opened the windows for lovely cross ventilation.  There was a lot of traffic noise throughout the night.<br/><br/>Other than that, it was a very smooth stay. Anthony is an efficient and thoughtful host."
3915,842800,2021-08-01,"Great place to stay, perfect location, very clean, spacious and comfortable!"
3916,670977,2019-11-12,"My husband and I stayed here for three nights with our two dogs. It had a great location near the subway station and a walkable distance to Prospect Park, which was enjoyable for both us and the dogs. It was very clean, had plenty of amenities, and was easy to check-in to. Made our first trip to NYC much easier than we expected!"
3917,292611,2019-08-27,Be sure to check out the music venue next door!
3918,850815,2021-03-09,It's was a beautiful and clean place
3919,529867,2021-07-20,"Lavonne's apartment was just what our family needed! The check in process was super easy and I appreciated Lavonne letting us park in her driveway during our stay. My husband and I enjoyed relaxing on the back patio after a long day in the city. The bed was super comfortable! I cant thank Lavonne enough for providing towels, body washes and shampoos, and kitchen utensils. We felt very at home and would return again!"
3920,845053,2021-03-26,"The perfect and central place in the heart of Chinatown. The living space is super spacious and well designed desptie being slightly different from the photos. I stayed here for a week an absolutely loved it. One negative comment is that the street is super loud, earplugs are a must."
3921,803075,2020-11-10,Thanks Maria had a great time ur very flexible & easy to work with.
3922,632532,2019-10-20,"My traveling companion and I really enjoyed ourselves. We needed an extra night and she was very accommodating. The place was nice and clean and a perfect room for multiple people. There were two full beds and two closest and dresser. It was plenty roomy.. the rest room was clean and well stocked. I believe the owner came and cleaned daily. Even though it was multiple people staying there it was never loud. The subway was literally one block away. They is also a nice deli and rite aid on the corner for a quick bite. Overall, nice place... I would recommend!!!"
3923,891788,2021-11-29,위치가 좋음<br/>다만 화장실이 방에 없고 다른 방들과 같이 공유해야되고 복도에서 불쾌한 냄새가 남<br/>그것말고는 가격대비 좋은 숙소<br/>방은 무난 깔끔

3933,740474,2021-04-24,"Cute place for a short stay, if you’re in and out. Very nice location, but a bit nosey, which was expected. The wifi wasn’t working the entire stay and the the check in process was a bit of a hassle. Overall, we had an okay experience."
3934,642522,2019-03-09,Great place. We needed a same night AirBnB cause we got double booked at another Airbnb and they got back to us immediately and were very easy to talk to.
3935,867563,2021-09-19,"Beautiful apartment just as described and seen in the pictures. Kimberly was helpful and quick with the communication when it came to any needs and questions we had. <br/>We really enjoyed the neighborhood - lots of great restaurants within walking distance (Mesa Coyoacan was particularly fantastic). And the subway was only a few minutes’ walk away for getting to other parts of the city. <br/>Comfy bed, cosy living area, large bathroom - overall, we were extremely happy with our stay! It was a nice calm oasis to return to after sightseeing."

3937,792408,2019-12-17,"Clean, great for our family of 4"
3938,440689,2021-08-21,"Angela’s place is wonderful, it has everything you could need, and a lot of space for a nyc apartment! It also has great views, and a short walk to Tompkins square, which has a ton of great food options nearby."
3939,412055,2019-06-08,"Very friendly and welcoming hosts! We felt like home. The location is perfect- literally two minutes from the C train and 10 from the G, close to very cool and great places to eat. They also have a lovely cat which will welcome you at the door! Money value is excellent for nyc!"
3940,692176,2019-08-17,"Great place, clean and host is very nice! Book it"
3941,567732,2019-12-28,Clean studio in a nice location. Good communication with host and checkin/checkout process was smooth.
3942,375641,2019-04-18,This place is a stone’s throw away from the station and on the main road to downtown so a trip to anywhere is only a matter of few minutes. Lots of restaurants and shopping malls around this area and at a walking distance from this house but the only downside is the train noise which disturbs at night and specially for kids.  Also being on the main road there's a constant rush of traffic or the cop cars on patrol so the noise bothers light sleepers and kids. I didn’t mind the only flight of stairs to the apartment. Washer is in the same floor so washing happens quickly. It's a great place to stay close to downtown but it's a bit noisy if you have small kids.
3943,446968,2019-04-30,"Unit is clean and had everything I needed. Benjamin was very responsive to issues I had to report and was able to resolve them: 1) dryers not working well at first, 2) lost internet connection in building. Was a little bit of a pain hauling laundry down several flights of stairs and at a cost of $5/load, but cost of unit was probably less than a unit with more conveniences. Building is older with ‘fussy’ faucets, but it has character and was still comfortable/homey. I would stay there again if price remained commensurate with other comp units."
3944,240435,2019-03-24,Nice and comfortable place! Grover was very hospitable and personally met with us during check in to make sure we’ve got everything we need and answer any questions. He also gave us some nice recommendations on local restaurants to try!

3951,809860,2020-10-25,"Posted Up on Putnam was one of the most comfortable stays I've had in New York! I was able to come and go as I please and it felt like I had my own apartment.  Helen was incredibly hospitable and gave great suggestions on where to go, and Omar was very friendly when I first arrived. I will be back!"

A lovely apartment with large windows (facing some trees, with an open view), large main bedroom, and very ample storage, right next to Central Park, Whole Foods, close to Trader Joe’s and express and local subway.   Great building staff, especially the concierge.  Very good communication with the hosts.  (For those who care about smaller things, we loved the excellent water pressure and the large bath, as well as the ability to regulate the temperature in the apartment).<br/><br/>Stayed for two months with my spouse and two small kids and really enjoyed the stay, including nearly ten playgrounds within short walking distance, as well as a public library with a children’s section.  Would highly recommend anyone staying in the apartment!"
3955,518487,2021-08-16,The house was great! Location and proximity to shops and restaurants was perfect. The house has everything you need.

3963,495888,2019-01-02,I just stayed at Tony’s place. This was a nice and convenient place to stay close to the train station. I was very pleased with the communication and he was very helpful with all questions and answered very promptly. He was also made it very easy for us by letting us check in earlier because of when we were arriving to town. Over all I was very pleased with the stay and would stay again.
3964,668955,2019-11-30,"Sade’s place is very conveniently located in Crown Heights, it’s nice and comfortable and a great value for a simple stay in Brooklyn.

3969,545127,2019-06-28,"Nous avons passé un super séjour dans cette petite maison ancienne et typique de ce quartier résidentiel de Brooklyn. Tout un étage pour nous 4, très confortable, joliment décoré. Tranquillité, hôtes très gentilles, disponibles et en même temps discrètes. Metro a 10 mn a pied. Proximité du magnifique Prospect Park."
3970,686835,2019-03-18,"Margaret and Matthew were extremely kind and accommodating hosts. They responded quickly to all communication. <br/><br/>Their studio is thoughtfully designed with modern finishes and all the luxuries as you would find in a hotel (plus more!). It is large and functional with many places to sit, rest, eat and talk. The fridge was stocked with food and drinks, which were much appreciated. There were many books on hand to read.<br/><br/>The location was perfect for our trip. It was close to prospect park and very convenient to get to restaurants and subways to manhattan. It is an extremely quiet (and beautiful) neighborhood. <br/><br/>We enjoyed our stay and will be back!"
3971,716691,2019-06-17,"We were greeted by Geli's housemate with two glasses of water, who made us feel welcome. The room and the house was exactly as shown in the pictures. Very clean linen. No window blinds. There was a constant noise coming from outside, like from an air ventilation system. Beside that, the room was just fine. The surroundings were ok, just two blocks from the subway. We recommend it."
3972,356964,2021-07-10,Steve keeps his beautiful apartment immaculately and he is an elegant gracious accommodating host. But it is more lovely than the pictures show.

3977,512906,2021-07-31,"Great little place! We came and stayed for a few weeks in July while we looked for an apartment. It was a perfect place to come back and relax after running around doing stressful things all day. We loved the shower and the kitchen!<br/><br/>The neighborhood is very quiet and clean. We did happen to come during some little league tournaments that were happening at the baseball field across the street but the noise wasn’t bothersome at all. The ice cream truck would also come by in the evenings. :) Even though it is a half hour drive to the ferry, the airbnb is 3 min away from the laundromat, and a 10 min drive to Trader Joe’s, Target, and the mall for anything you might need during your stay which was so convenient for us. <br/><br/>Nick and Maria were great hosts and were quick to respond to any questions or problems that came up. We set off the fire alarm at one point while frying some noodles and they were very understanding about it. We really appreciate their great hospitality!!! :)"
3978,597597,2019-12-16,"Hôte très gentille et disponible. Appartement situé très près d’un métro avec un accès rapide à Manhattan, mais un peu bruyant en raison de cette proximité. Bon rapport qualité-prix!"
3979,557688,2019-02-25,"Gene's place is a wonderful find for anyone wanting to spend the day in Manhattan. We could walk to Central Park, the restaurants nearby but still is very quiet and peaceful."
3980,545106,2019-05-08,"Beautiful apartment in beautiful Brooklyn!  Lori was super responsive and helpful, and the space couldn’t have been better.  Spotlessly clean, comfortable beds and pillows, nice linens, comfortable seating, lovely kitchen.  It has been freshly but respectfully renovated, preserving all the original details.  Lori provides an excellent neighborhood guide as well, and makes all the house instructions very clear.  Very likely we’ll be back!"
3981,708869,2021-03-17,"Lovely and comfy home , super clean and quick replies and let’s not forget the beautiful parking spot waiting for you. Definitely would book again !"
3982,376596,2019-01-08,"Local bem localizado, próximo ao metrô. Local confortável, mas se você for brasileiro como nós e gostar de bastante utensílios de cozinha, pode ficar um pouco na mão! Local legal para duas pessoas! Bom para café da manhã e jantar!  <br/>Um ponto negativo é a escadaria do prédio, pois não tem elevador e fica no 4 andar!<br/>Estacionamento é fácil, na rua do prédio e nas adjacentes tem vaga, mas é preciso ficar atento com os dias e horários que não pode estacionar, eles multam mesmo!  <br/>O apartamento é confortável! Vale o preço!"
3983,754350,2020-12-14,Nice room
3984,775770,2019-09-30,Great host. Very helpful.
3985,647346,2019-08-26,"While they were prompt to reply when we expressed our concerns. They failed to inform us upon arrival that there was a refrigerator in the kitchen that had residue from rotten food in it. They sent their son to let us in, he was very nice. Unfortunately they told him to tell us that the appliance had broken then very day so we could not use it. This is impossible given the rancid smell that came from it and the abundance of fruit flies that poured out upon opening in. In addition to the ones that were already present on the kitchen. It simply did not add up. I suspect that the refrigerator had been broken for some time and they neglected to move it or take care of the fruit flies before our arrival. Additionally, mold was growing from the ceiling in the kitchen that was substantial. It had to have been there for quite some time for it to spore so much. This was a huge concern for me as it is a health issue. I would have never followed through had I been informed of this or had accurate pictures been posted.<br/>Had I know of the fruit flies, the mildew and unkempt bathroom, and the mold on the kitchen ceiling, and that we would be kept up until almost 2am each night because of children or someone stomping upstairs, I would have taken my money elsewhere. I feel incredibly mislead. <br/>We would have gone somewhere else but given the festival and the cost we simply could not use that option. Very unfortunately first experience."
3986,865403,2021-06-25,Host was great. Place was clean. Good value for a nights stay.
3987,488523,2021-06-30,"I stayed at Felicia and wills brownstone for a month, and I could not have asked for a better stay! I was coming from one of those apartments turned Airbnb in an already established apartment complex, where the two companies are in the same building, but separate. I found that the experience was not nearly as personable, or high quality as staying with locals who you can communicate with so much easier. The studio is gorgeous, as is the brownstone, and equipped with everything you need. Lovely kitchen, and very comfortable bed. The juke box and the monkey cafe around the corner were great finds. There was also FREE live music on Saturdays at the harlem gift shop just down the block. I will be recommending and staying in will and felicias place in the future!"
3988,286107,2021-11-02,"Essam was a welcoming, charming host, full of wisdom and conversation. The apartment was clean and everything as he described in the listing. Bed is very comfortable, as some other guests have also mentioned. Location can't be beat, and is easy access to so many things in Manhattan and easy enough access to the subway to go other places. Parking is somewhat available on the cross streets if you happen to be driving (just pay attention to the alternate side street parking cleaning signs, as well as the suspension schedule on the city website). Would recommend, and would stay again without question, especially for the price."
3989,713017,2021-06-17,Enjoyed the stay!
3990,889732,2021-11-04,Place is very comfy and clean. The host is very nice and understanding. My mother and really appreciated her for letting us book with our last minute situation. Decently recommend. We loved how the building had a working elevator.
3991,870589,2021-08-08,Had a great time! The location is unbeatable and the apartment is super cozy and artistic. Joseph was very friendly and a great communicator. He went above and beyond making sure my stay went as smoothly as possible. Would love to come back!
3992,464601,2021-08-12,"Ed and Isabell are fantastic hosts. <br/>The apartment is super clean and sparkling upon arrival.<br/>It's simple but has everything that you need. We cooked dinner and the kitchen was cute and cozy. <br/><br/>The location is perfectly located for exploring the beach, boardwalk, parks and surrounding neighborhood. <br/><br/>The review that complained about the area just doesn't get NY. This is un- gentrified Brooklyn and all the better for it.<br/>Viva La Coney Island!"
3993,865726,2021-09-18,Great apt for a quick getaway. Host was super nice.
3994,507538,2019-03-28,"Adeyemi's place is sparkling clean, location is near many stores, and nearby the subway station. Wish I knew how to get to the backyard. However, people are friendly and made my stay comfortable."
3995,858828,2021-08-21,"I had a great time living at Amiee’s place for 3 months. The place was really quite and clean, great place to wind down after a long day in the city/working. There a few things that I’d like to note about the listing: <br/>1. There’s isnt air conditioning in that specific room, there’s running vents and an air tower but it still gets uncomfortably hot in the room on days warmer than 85 degrees. The living area is quite cold though which is nice!<br/>2. There isn’t any pots, pans, or utensils to use, make sure to bring your own.<br/>3. There’s a housekeeper that cleans everyday in the kitchen and your bathroom - the bathroom for this room is in the living area, but your the only one in the apartment without a bathroom so nobody really uses it :)<br/>4. The bed is very comfortable!<br/>5. The F/A train is about a 6 minute walk away, B/D is 15 min, and the 4/5/6 is 16 min. <br/>6. The owners were amazing and very sweet. They live in the building I think because they would be very fast to respond and help. <br/><br/>I hope this review helps! I would recommend staying here, it’s a great place to live in NYC for a decent price."
3996,832037,2021-05-11,Very convenient location. Would stay there again if in the area

4000,654863,2019-08-25,"The space, as advertised, is indeed small. However the location is perfect, 10 minutes away from times square and Central Park by walk. <br/>Also Julian is a really good host, he gave us tons of very good recommendation and tips."
4001,603531,2019-04-23,Leesha and her husband were great hosts.  The location of their place was  in close proximity to the subway train stop (about 100 yards away).  She made us a hot breakfast each morning and was  extremely gracious.<br/><br/>Overall Leesha’s place is one of the best values in the city and we would absolutely stay with them again if we are back in the area in the future!
4002,867248,2021-07-02,It was ok . Just no air cons in all rooms
4003,859733,2021-09-12,"Luis' place is so luxurious-feeling and well-equipped for a few weeks of living in Brooklyn. My partner and I stayed for a week and were delighted by and so comfortable in the space. We cooked a lot and were happy to find the kitchen so well-equipped. The place is a few blocks from Eastern Parkway, beautiful for walks, and around the corner from a lovely park. It's a really great location to enjoy Brooklyn and Prospect Park. Will certainly stay again and will send friends and family there."
4004,682027,2019-06-13,Ester was super nice with a lovely home. It was an easy ride into Manhattan. Would definitely stay there again.

4006,465755,2019-05-02,The Place was much better than expected!! Mirela and Daniel did everything to make the time at the apartment comfortable.

The Apartment is in a quiet area and is really nice! I will def. stay here again on my next NYC trip!!

4010,722378,2019-09-14,"Great place for the price, fairly good location, great host. There were some issues with cockroaches in the bathroom but with it being New York in very humid weather that was pretty inevitable. They were all cleaned out by the morning by the people living in the house anyway."
4011,738788,2019-07-23,"Book with confidence. Great studio! Photos don’t do it justice. Only 7 min walk to the subway station (direct line to central Manhattan). Rose is a great host, she communicated effectively throughout. Will definitely be coming back. 5 stars!"

4018,877283,2021-11-15,"Absolutely Perfect! The apartment was spotless, the bed was super comfortable, and we had tons of space to spread out. The kitchen was perfectly set up for us to have coffee breakfast at the apartment. The location was superb especially if you have tickets for Broadway or the opera and the proximity to the museums and central park can't be beat. The bedroom was dark and so quiet, which is a rarity in the city. Sab was a lovely host and our communication was a breeze. Check in and out were also so easy. We will stay here every time we come to NYC!"

4021,540554,2019-01-19,"El departamento de Gulcin es genial, no es lo más lujoso de la ciudad pero el precio es excelente para tu estadía si tu objetivo principal es visitar la ciudad. La ubicación es lo mejor, está a pasos del metro, está lleno de delis, tiendas de café, tiendas de teléfonos, y a unas cuantas cuadras de Chinatown, Little Italy y Soho. Vas a encontrar todo lo que necesitas en el departamento, la cama es cómoda y en invierno es cálido y acogedor. El único problema es que está en un 4to piso sin ascensor. Buen host!"

4029,716725,2020-03-07,"Ubytování bylo skvělé. Byt byl čistý. Pokoj, v kterém jsme spali byl malý, ale úplně stačil. K dispozici jsme měli obývací pokoj, koupelnu, kuchyň. Ubytujici nám daly prostor, moc jsme je neviděli a když už ano, tak byly moc příjemný. Ubytování je kousek od metra."
4030,460672,2021-08-16,"Great price and a wonderful space! The apartment was larger than I expected and I was pleasantly surprised! I’m from Brooklyn, so this is a great location to get pretty much anywhere you want to go in NYC. The J and C trains are a short walk away. Lots of good food and culture in the area. The owners were very easy to communicate with, and when I had a question, they responded right away. I love New York, and we hope to return soon! Y"
4031,796568,2020-09-14,"Very nice place, just make sure you don’t park in the driveway, because the neighbors will attack you, make sure you park in the streets. I can’t say much about the host didn’t get to meet her but she answer my messages quickly, the place was clean and very cozy"

4034,325042,2019-05-08,"This is a lovely, interesting space just a block away from a subway station with access to multiple lines and located right in Chinatown. There was an unfortunate issue with the plumbing in the building during our stay, but Patrice and her assistants were very communicative and accommodating throughout the repairs—and if such an inconvenience had to happen I'm glad we had such a kind host. Definitely would recommend."
4035,757699,2019-11-23,"Robert and Liz are the pillar of hospitality at its finest. Their helpfulness and flexibility with checkin times is unmatched.  They were a pleasant to chat with and responded right away to email messages. Their apartment was extremely clean, and very comfortable. I look forward to renting from them again the next time I need to be in the city."
4036,676919,2019-04-18,They require you to remove your shoes before entering their home.
4037,733173,2019-07-29,David’s place was super nice and located right next to the two major trains we used all week. The apartment was bigger than I anticipated and really cute. We will definitely stay here again in the future!

4042,534614,2020-10-20,we got a nice view of the park from our bedroom window. He checked in on us during the stay to make sure every thing was okay. Bathroom was cleaned and garbage was taken out frequently throughout the trip. There's a cute bar around the corner and some bomb chinese food called Hardee's.
4043,604727,2019-11-09,这是我第一次使用airbnb. 体验非常好。Evelyn用 (Hidden by Airbnb) 和我及时联系，解答我的问题。坐地铁到曼哈顿并不麻烦，相比住在曼哈顿节约多了，而且房间也很干净，还有厨房可以简单煮点吃的。附近有几个超市，东西都非常丰富，价格也不贵。周围餐厅也很多。很好的体验，强烈推荐~
4044,155655,2019-07-30,"Quite a good place for a budget location in an extraordinary Manhattan location. The place needs a bit more care though, it feels quite dated. The restroom on the hallway is private and reserved for the apartment, but the door cannot be closed from the inside. The entrance to the bathroom is quite narrow, a bulkier person may find it cumbersome to use. The air conditioning is a bit noisy overnight but using it on ""fan"" mode worked out fine for us. Be careful with the front door of the building as it may be closed at night and early morning.<br/>Overall a nice stay, but don't expect it to be extraordinary."
4045,120665,2020-04-18,LOVED IT HERE! WISH I COULD HAVE STAYED LONGER! DEFINITELY RECOMMEND!
4046,708963,2019-05-28,"Ty's place was perfect for my stay in New York!  The neighborhood is calm and peaceful, and I was able to get a great night's rest after a long trip. The bed is comfortable, the room was clean and the rest of Ty's apartment was also clean. Check in was easy, and the area felt safe when I was walking at night. The nightlife in the surrounding areas in Brooklyn is awesome and there are good restaurant options, so it was a nice balance. The place is also very easily accessible and a quick walk from the metro. I would definitely stay here again!"
4047,341885,2021-07-24,Repeat stay with Barry. He's such a great host and keeps his space just right. Good eats close by and parking is as good as it gets in the city! Barry provides everything you need for an overnight and offers up excellent long term. keep up the great work super host!

4061,736011,2019-05-27,"First and foremost Damien is a great host who was very kind, responsive and helpful. He went above and beyond when we found ourselves in a bad situation (my gf lost her passport).<br/>The flat was located in a nice Brooklyn neighborhood with close proximity to a subway station that can directly take you to Manhattan, which was super useful. <br/>The flat itself is spacious & sun-lit, with all amenities present for a good stay. <br/><br/>Overall, if you get a chance to book Damien's flat, don't hesitate to do it :)"

4068,819081,2021-08-08,"We had a wonderful stay in Park Slope and would highly recommend Jack's Airbnb.  The location was perfect to get around Brooklyn and Manhattan, as well as having so many extra touches not found in many Airbnbs.  Thank you for a wonderful stay!"
4069,688823,2019-02-16,This person is a complete fraud . They had the incorrect address on airbnb and she wrote all these notes about how great their stay was and put them in the apt while she said she was new to airbnb. There are cameras all over the property. Claims she is ta or tami while I have text msgs telling me her true name. I would not risk ever staying at this crazy persons house . They drove my wife so crazy she is still in the hospital from their verbal abuse and deceiving tactics. They stole stuff from me . They are liars and will most likely be arrested so they won't even be able to have anyone ever stay there again.

I stayed for over 3 months and if I didn't have to return home due to COVID-19, I would have stayed here much longer! They are amazing hosts- very quick to respond, keep the place super clean, and are were very willing to accommodate when I had any concerns. I couldn't have asked for a better stay during my time in Brooklyn and I would DEFINITELY stay with them again!"
4081,514410,2019-04-28,Elena’s place is everything as described. The location is in a great area close to shopping and dining and buses and trains. It's an old NYC apartment.  I highly recommend Denise’s Airbnb!
4082,866827,2021-10-12,"Henry's place was lovely. Check-in was quick and easy, and the room was clean, cute, and had a lot of light, a desk, and A/C. Because the room was on the opposite side of the apt as Henry's, it afforded relative privacy!"
4083,463182,2019-09-20,Melissa is a very helpful and understanding host.

4086,562998,2019-05-06,"Mary's place was quite a gem in Brooklyn. It's near the Brooklyn Museum station and has all sorts of places where to eat or buy groceries around. <br/>The space is really well divided and it was a pleasure to meet the other room-mate, a really lovely lady from West Virginia with whom I had a couple of breakfasts.<br/>Everything was quite clean and my room was noise free. I was free to go out and come back whenever I wanted and Mary has been suuuuper willing with everything.<br/>The nice kitchen is useful to have any meal at home and she even had shampoo and conditioner in the bathroom (but I already had brought mine).<br/>This room is highly recommended and I will probably be again her guest when I will come back to NY."

4088,869879,2021-09-29,"It was clean and plenty of space in a good location. This place is very dark with nearly no daylight. Windows are hard or not to open, for getting fresh air we opened entrance and back door. Sleeping rooms are in cellar. Price/Value ratio is not good."
4089,891014,2021-11-23,"Hersheys place is absolutely amazing. I am a native of the neighborhood, of 30 years and when I tell you I totally forgot where I was while I stayed in Hersheys unit! <br/><br/>The unit is as photographed, but in my opinion photos don’t do it justice. The unit is conveniently located next to the train station making a commute to the city super easy and fast. The unit is also surrounded by lots of amazing food options and supermarkets. If you like to shop, there are also nice boutiques and major retailers with-in a 5 block radius. <br/><br/>Definitely stay here if you’re visiting NYC or looking for a staycation like myself."

4092,592900,2021-07-11,todo muy bien
4093,824542,2021-06-17,"The location and facilities were more than I expected. The equipment was super clean. There are many restaurants nearby, and there are many Ubers even if you don't have a car. You can get to major areas for $10-30. If you go sightseeing by car, parking in New York is incredibly expensive. Of course there are many taxis.  <br/>It is just right for sightseeing. I want to stay here again."
4094,721918,2019-11-09,"Cozy place, perfect for group of 4. Nice host and convenient neighborhood close to metro."
4095,845293,2021-09-02,"Billies Hideway was a nice spacious room right next 2 the shared bath. Wi-Fi was strong really appreciated the oscillating fan, helped dry me out after getting caught outside on NYC flood night caused by Ida. Be advised this room in on 3rd floor, some very steep steps, use those handrails. It was nice to hav snacks, water & coffee already prearranged in the room. Watch the signs for the street parking, I was able to locate just a few steps from the front door. Noise was never an issue, Thx !"
4096,867012,2021-10-10,"What a great space!!!!  Clean, private, fun, secure...  Justin is an excellent host and very accommodating to our schedules and needs.  Just perfect...  you won't regret it!"

4098,707930,2021-07-13,Misha was very easy to work with; was very accommodating and responded quickly to any messages.  Over all the place was great with lots of space.  Used the place to host family for my wedding; and couldn’t have asked for a better place that worked so well.
4099,519455,2019-12-25,"The room is very nice.the water  in the bath room is hot and strong.and it is very easy to check in，you won't meet other customers during your visit<br/>Although the sound proof isnt very good, it is a quiet neighborhood<br/>it take about 10min walk to the subway station. but it's safe to walk around at midnight<br/>however the floor is a little sticky, you may want to bring your  own slippers<br/>性价比很高，房间不错冰箱微波炉洗手间都有<br/>整体很感觉，地板稍稍有点脏。卫生间水很热也很稳定<br/>房东回复很快，入住很方便，不会和其它住户碰面，几乎是独立公寓."

The location was great, subway station was close and it took us around 25 min to get to Midtown Manhattan. Room looked exactly like in the pictures. Overall, good value for money."
4105,424041,2020-01-02,The host is wonderful and lovely. It was the best stay in NYC we could get during NYE holiday.
4106,352448,2019-04-17,"Ramond, Eric and Steven were fantastic hosts! Really welcoming and made the place feel like home. The room itself was very private, which was nice. Plenty of storage options and would be perfect for a longer than usual stay. The dog, Winston, was a gem. Absolutely lovely and well-trained - I actually got quite sad when leaving and saying goodbye to him! Location wise, the subway is a 2min walk and 10-15mins into Manhattan depending on where you want to end up. So for the price, it's a steal. <br/><br/>Great vibes and interior too! Thoughtfully decorated and styled, which made the stay all the more enjoyable. Make sure you make the 10 second walk to Roberta's, which is regarded top 3-4 pizzas in New York."
4107,197361,2021-11-28,A great spot—lots of room and great mattress.

They are amazing communicators- sending us tons of recommendations before we arrived to Richard meeting us to show us their apartment. <br/>Their apartment is pristine!<br/>Great kitchen, comfy bed, and endless towels!

4120,822956,2021-09-08,"Clean house, check in easy enough, WiFi does not work at all. If WiFi is not important then highly recommend but if you have to get work done I suggest going somewhere else"
4121,889940,2021-11-21,"John and Malisa were very quick and responsive hosts. they answered all our questions promptly and we appreciated that. Street parking. was relatively easy to find a parking spot close enough to walk to the unit. Check-in was super easy. The airbnb itself is a small basement unit. It does have rather low ceilings but should be fine for an individual under 6 ft in height. The bedroom and bathroom area are rather small, but the living room/kitchen area is decently spacious. The rooms were all clean, but the bedsheets themselves looked a little old and iffy. We found several strands of hair on them and they don't look like they were properly washed/cleaned (I've relayed this to the hosts so hopefully they will address this for their guests going forward). Aside from that one thing, this would be a good place for a quick stay."
4122,853905,2021-06-01,Can’t beat the location and value. Cozy spot with nice roommates and chill cats. Valentina was great! Helpful and super easy communication . Had a very comfortable stay.
4123,626003,2019-08-30,"We couldn’t have asked for a more perfect stay! Catherine’s apartment, apart from being GORGEOUS and huge, was in a great location. The neighbourhood was quiet, the subway was close by, there was a Levain Bakery just around the corner (a dream!) and lovely restaurants dotted along the roads.<br/><br/>The apartment itself was mind blowing. Everything was so stylish and well thought out, and each guest basically had their own floor, which was amazing. I wish we could’ve stayed longer, because we felt right at home.<br/><br/>Thank you to Catherine for the incredible stay - we will definitely be back!"
4124,853641,2021-03-22,"Sooooo..... this place is dope! Nalani’s place is exactly my vibe. Natural wood furniture, clean open kitchen, nice private bathroom with a deep tub!! ( only thing missing is a few more plants and I’d live here permanently) <br/><br/>Nalani was super responsive and hospitable. Perfect balance of giving me my privacy and being a friendly face. 10/10 would recommend this stay. <br/><br/>Bonus for travelers, like a 5 minute walk to the train, takes you right into Manhattan!"
4125,500706,2019-08-27,The host canceled this reservation 3 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
4126,848424,2021-03-10,Sa was so nice and the room was just enough room for my partner and I to crash. Great spot in China town with a cute coffee shop downstairs. I feared the the stairs at first but it’s really not bad. Overall nice stay nice price. Thanks again Sa!

4130,866500,2021-07-04,"Let me put y’all on…Brook’s listing is amazing. The location was A1 — the A and C train station is literally a block and half away. We were able to get to Manhattan in less than 20 minutes. Also, easy access to CitiBike which is  right across the street so we were able to get some fresh air while easily biking around Brooklyn. The unit decor is stylish and the candles added a nice, warm touch upon our arrival. Communication was smooth and the listing was very clean!! Can’t go wrong booking this listing…highly recommended for the true NYC experience."
4131,372772,2021-11-16,"What a really great location.   Williamsburg shopping, dining, coffee all within a few blocks.   Very close to the L train.   15 minutes to get into lower Manhattan.    Just a great long weekend visiting one the best parts of NYC.   Sidiq was responsive and flexible.   Great owner.   The only reason I would not give this a 5-star review is it is not what I would call a ""luxury"" stay.    But, hey, you would pay probably double for a luxury stay and this was everything we could have asked for.   Definitely will look this property up next time in NYC."
4132,842510,2021-03-11,The hotel was clean and the service was friendly from the staff.
4133,871319,2021-07-12,"If you have ever lived in Brooklyn, you know what to expect in a third-floor walk-up. What you don't expect is how quiet it is at night and how wonderful it is to wake up to all the birds in the trees out back.

The apartment feels like my New York home and June and Steve’s high standards never disappoint!"
4145,882216,2021-09-03,"This space was as pictured,<br/>It is beautiful, comfortable safe and clean. <br/>I happened to book for work and the weather conditions were awful, it was a hurricane and tornado watch. This house is placed on a safe and beautiful street. Easy to find parking. My car was perfectly safe, wasn’t damaged by any fallen trees or flooded. The bnb is in the basement, it didn’t have any flooding or water damage, it was perfect and quiet and Nonie was so easy to contact if needed. I would recommend this to every and anybody that wants a nice, intimate quiet space"
4146,880095,2021-11-01,The place was very clean and we were able to find all of the cleaning items we were needing. The place is very close to the subway station so we were able to move around the city at any time of the day. It has a beautiful view. The bed is comfortable for two people as well.
4147,305566,2019-01-03,The host is the sweetest host among all I’ve ever met. She is very nice and helpful. The room is neat and clean. You’ll get everything that you’ve been told in the Airbnb website. I would recommend this place to everyone.
4148,885088,2021-09-23,"If you are tired of being one of many in large, corporate hotels and are ready for a more intimate experience look no further than the Blue Moon Hotel. It’s a beautiful place filled to the brim with history and you can tell how much time, artistry, and love went into creating the place. The accommodations are cozy, the views are top notch, and the staff is friendly and really make the Blue Moon Hotel what it is. So next time you’re in New York give it a try. When you are sitting on your terrace overlooking the city, sipping coffee, and encountering smiling faces every time you walk downstairs you may just not want to leave."
4149,177960,2019-01-02,"Everything about our stay was amazing. Communication was wonderful Jed was extremely responsive AND helpful. Checking/out easy. The apartment itself was spotless, convenient and incredibly trendy. Location was awesome, easy walk to anything and everything you’d need. Jed was probably the best host we’ve had to date!"
4150,813778,2021-10-16,"Lugar hermoso , pero con mucho elitismo"
4151,371386,2019-06-15,Tout était parfait de l’emplacement à la propreté dans l’appartement.<br/>Celui-ci est en revanche un peu bruyant mais cela ne nous a pas dérangé outre mesure
4152,772707,2021-09-18,We enjoyed the apartment for 6 day stay and this is safe area. The apartment is clean and large.  The subway station is very close.
4153,649412,2021-04-21,Exactly as described. Thanks for the hospitality!
4154,763680,2021-03-14,"Great studio apartment. Freddy was very quick to respond to any questions. The apartment was very clean, and came with everything you needed. Would definitely stay here again"
4155,520464,2020-12-15,Nini is the consummate super host<br/>Great location and very clean apartment.<br/>She was readily available when ever I needed something.<br/>Will definitely stay again whenever I visit NYC
4156,698682,2019-08-10,"Cinthya's place is close to a bus stop and a subway station, so it is easy to get around. Communication was excellent. Quick responses."
4157,284186,2019-01-06,This is my fifth time staying with Esteban and the only place I stay while in NYC. Always a great pleasure to stay with him. Hospitable and very understanding. Thank you again Esteban!
4158,704895,2019-08-23,Nice place to overnight for a connecting flight.
4159,750520,2019-11-18,Definitely a Great Place to Stay for a Few Days!! Very Clean  Host was Very Nice
4160,851024,2021-05-05,Beautiful room
4161,275118,2021-10-27,"Great location. Although we didn’t use the subway, it was located within easy walking distance. Good deli’s close by and one block from  Central Park. Beds were comfortable. Host was very response to our questions. Would recommend and we would stay again."
4162,716035,2020-07-19,"Very nice & kind. Did not bother us the whole trip unless we asked, the place is so clean and pretty !!! The location is great . Free- parking, neighbors were kind. It is definitely worth the price !!!!!"
4163,787535,2019-12-26,Traveling with a disability is hard doubly so during the holidays. Luckily I found Yoslyn’s place. She is a wonderful human being. Our in-person interactions were infrequent but she was always just a quick text away and always ready to reply instantly. The upstairs unit was perfect for our needs. The acute stairs are a bit much but we managed. The place is kept very clean and could easily accommodate multiple guests.  A portapen is in the back if you’re traveling with a wee one. The kitchen seemed well stocked for small meals and with a drip coffee maker(although I prefer the pod brewers when traveling) there are two televisions with access to a few popular streaming services. <br/>One of the greatest features was proximity to the Soundview ferry. Literally a 5min walk and a 20/30min ride to midtown (2019 current fare $2.75)<br/>I would absolutely check here first when I next need temporary accommodations.
4164,867301,2021-06-13,"Great place for a 3-4 day stay in NYC. Quick rundown of the do's and don'ts in the beginning and then you're good to go. Very friendly people, and knowledgeable about NYC. Harlem is central to everything and this place is right around 125th Street. The only issue, for me, was the shower was kinda small, but I'm a lil wider than most."
4165,776603,2021-05-03,"Loved the stay, very tranquil and relaxing including great service 10/10"
4166,855577,2021-11-08,Richard is very prompt with communication as well as any needs that you might have. Room is small but was fine for our needs as we only needed a sleeping space. Good location.
4167,791880,2020-01-01,"The studio was very spacious and clean. We shared a bathroom with the yoga studio but we were not inconvenienced by having to share a bathroom at all. Alex is very nice and was a great host! The area is also next to several bars, restaurants, convenience stores, Starbucks, the subway, etc. Overall it was a great location and we had a great time for NYE!"
4168,413759,2019-08-17,"This place is convenient, check-in was very easy and I LOVE being able to bring my dog on vacation with me. The back yard was a great feature- even though my dog prefers to walk around prospect park for hours it’s nice to have the option to let him out back in the morning while I run across the street for French pastries. My son also loved the small fire-pit out back and ran next door to the market for marshmallows as soon as he had a chance.<br/><br/>Declan was very responsive to messages (immediately got back to me when I booked, the day of check in and when I had questions).<br/><br/>The subway is very close and while it’s not loud you do hear/feel a low rumble once in a while especially when all else is quiet. The place could use some TLC and another AC unit in the bedroom like the nice/new one in the front room."
4169,98189,2019-08-08,"Great place to stay if you are going to NY to know the city. All subway stations are no more than 10 minutes away and the Central Park is three blocks away.<br/><br/>Beside the location, the space is very clean, specially the bathroom. Bed was very comfortable and the kitchen has everything you need.<br/><br/>Marina was always there if we need something.<br/><br/>Note if you are traveling with heavy handbags, there's no elevator and the stairs may be a struggle.<br/><br/>I definitely recommend the place and look forward to stay there again."
4170,810377,2021-03-19,Marie’s place was in a great location in the city and a great value for the space! Marie was very responsive to all of my questions.  Would recommend this place to friends!
4171,502235,2021-08-02,Great location! Host responded quickly and was very easy to communicate with. Also had a baby play pen we could use and checked in with us during our stay. We never had that before so it was very appreciated!! We had a great time and hope to come again!
4172,600550,2019-12-01,Good place to stay at as long as the other tenants aren't dirty.
4173,564406,2021-10-02,"Sasha's place was lovely. The bed was comfortable, the location was excellent, and everything was in tip-top shape. Would stay there again in a heartbeat."
4174,377093,2021-02-27,"Dena was a responsive host offering a comfy clean place in a terrific location! A well stocked kitchen which was handy as well as a nice sofa from which to watch included premium channels and Netflix.<br/>The bed was comfortable... plenty of storage, closet space, fluffy towels, and a huge book of recommendations on things to do and places to eat! I would absolutely book another stay on my next visit to NY!"

4178,621096,2021-08-11,Great stay! Kemar has such a lovely flat and is very accommodating! Would recommend to anyone looking for a place to stay in Brooklyn!
4179,788607,2020-07-25,Great host quick responses. Brownstone was way bigger than I expected. The pictures don’t do this place justice. It even has 3 sky lights. It’s close to trains and buses and within walking distance (a New Yorkers walking distance) to everything. The kitchen is huge and because of COVID we had to do a lot of our own cooking which made this place really convenient.
4180,873916,2021-09-27,"Andrada and Will’s place is a Brooklyn gem . For us , it was affordable with unique , fun decor and treats to boot !  Subway was only a coupla blocks away too . We were happy we discovered this  delightful Airbnb location ."
4181,883600,2021-11-16,"Clean, fun neighbourhood, close to Soho"
4182,400879,2019-10-25,Could not ask for better service! Absolutely amazing hospitality.  Fernando went above and beyond what was expected. Cozy clean space with a great location
4183,826569,2021-06-13,Not bad but  not amazing either.
4184,834717,2021-04-30,"Fernando was a great host, and very quick with communication! The description is accurate, and you get what you pay for. It was clean and the room was bigger than we expected. There is a kitchen that you can use if needed, and the bathroom was clean as well. The location is not the best, so keep that in mind. But overall a great stay! Would definitely recommend for the price."
4185,754651,2019-10-13,You can rest assure that this house will exceed you expectations. Very clean and looks newly updated inside. Amenities were very nice and my group of 5 had no issues with anything due to how prepared this house was. This house is overall the perfect place for a quick night out.
4186,402421,2019-07-14,"Wonderful hosts, very helpful, friendly and kind. Convenient to NYC by train. Great place to stay. Would recommend. Would stay again."

4199,815154,2021-08-08,"This place is fabulous!! The location is excellent, there is a grocery store just across the street. The place itself was very clean and well decorated, lots of information on what to do in the area/NYC in general. Street parking is free, but make sure that you don’t park in the parking lot for the complex itself."
4200,342935,2019-01-06,"The place is super comfy, cozy and clean. The living room has a great space and the kitchen has everything you need for cooking. Internet is fast and efficient, and Jabari is the best host ever, super attentive and helpful."
4201,516696,2020-06-25,"Yuval was an excellent host. He was great with communication both before our stay and during. We were able to use the kitchen and common area for working, which was extremely appreciated since I am working from home right now.

4206,706840,2020-04-03,Great listing
4207,597673,2020-12-08,"Alex & Yoly's home was phenomenal and extremely comfortable. It was the perfect space for myself and my little ones to get away. The neighborhood is fantastic and Central Park is very near. As a native New Yorker visiting the city after sometime, it was quite refreshing to have a place to stay and hosts who were so gracious to share their home. By far my BEST Airbnb experience."
4208,455736,2019-07-20,Stella was a wonderful host. Her place was a very short walk to the bus and train. Shopping area is a short 8 mins walk away. Stella always welcomed us with a smile and light conversation. I definitely look forward to my next stay with her whenever I’m in NY again.
4209,274360,2019-11-11,"Tras una larga estancia en casa de Patricia solo podemos darle las gracias por su hospitalidad y flexibilidad. La habitación y el baño son pequeños pero suficientes para un par de personas si vas de turismo por NY ya que la mayor parte del tiempo se pasa en la calle. <br/><br/>La ubicación es muy buena, con varias líneas de metro en las inmediaciones.<br/><br/>Muy simpática y amable nos ha hecho, en las medidas de sus posibilidades, la estancia mucho más agradable."
4210,671518,2021-07-27,Looks ok

4212,398240,2021-05-16,I actually planned a surprise birthday weekend for my sister and I am so glad we went with Jeannines place! <br/><br/>The apartment was super tidy and spacious and the response time was amazing! I will for sure be booking another stay in the future.

4214,764525,2019-11-18,"This is a very nice, clean, spacious set of rooms  with a well stocked kitchen. It was more room than I needed but perfect for visiting my son who lives a few blocks away.  You do have to enter through the main door of the house and go up through the family’s space but the top floor was very private except for the family cat who was a regular visitor when I was there. I will go back next time I’m in Brooklyn."
4215,555608,2019-03-18,"Be prepared to climb several flights of stairs every day, not recommend for elderly or out of shape people. Convenient location"
4216,642939,2019-08-30,Great place tucked away in East Williamsburg. Anthony was super responsive and accommodating. Definitely recommend this place for the value!
4217,608995,2019-01-03,"The Bronx is certainly edgy, but that only added to the experience of my first time in NY, being able to experience the main thing as well as the burbs. It is definitely a fab location in terms of walking distance to the subway. We especially loved the close proximity to the Dunkin' Donuts! Samuel was a wonderful host, even printing off our theater tickets and offering to fetch top ups of amenities for us like coffee on his errands. He is certainly on the ball if you have any questions or requests. The apartment is super quirky, with some proper character and most likely has everything you can think of in terms of needs. My mum loved the jacuzzi feature of the bath!"
4218,860960,2021-04-21,Joseph is a great easy going host. The room was super clean and the apartment is located close to many interesting things. if you are artsy and a music lover it's a great place to stay!

4230,261589,2021-08-21,"I stayed at Miriam's brownstone for almost a week. Miriam and her family are friendly, wonderful hosts, and the home is in a prime location in Fort Greene. It's surrounded by great restaurants and cafes and also walkable to downtown Brooklyn, Prospect Heights, etc. The guest room is very comfortable - particularly the bed! And the guest bathroom is private. I had no complaints - just would note to anyone who has trouble with stairs that there are a lot of stairs. I found Miriam's to be a great value compared with hotel rooms in Brooklyn, and would recommend it to other travelers."
4231,322792,2021-09-21,Great host! Very helpful and great area to explore
4232,27770,2021-11-27,"Peter’s place was perfect for our family of 4. We have two young kids and they stayed in a room with two twin beds while my husband and I had our own room with plenty of space to have a cocktail when they went to bed! It’s located near a subway station, a nice walk to the ferry and near plenty of food/coffee places. <br/><br/>It’s beautifully designed, clean and well stocked if you need to cook or stay in! Highly recommend to anyone looking for a QUIET place to stay!"

4237,636480,2019-10-14,"Good location, check in was really easy. Room was clean, bed comfy. Would stay again :)"
4238,858220,2021-07-29,"Several issues with this stay.  Firstly, the host was over an hour late with dropping the keys off for the apartment and did not communicate that she was running late.  I had someone waiting in front the apartment and the only way I realized that she was running late was by calling her.  When she dropped the keys off, she told me that the apartment had a small leak, nothing significant, in the bathroom.  Big understatement:  the leak required regular mopping and went from the bathroom to the bedroom carpet.  She promised to have maintenance look at the leak and correct the problem.  She visited the apartment twice, maintenance visited twice.  The leak was never fixed.  She didn't give updates or check in if the guests were ok with the leak.  The guests were there for about a month.  I couldn't move them because they were flown in for a business opening and with such short notice, I couldn't find any available lodgings within budget in the area.  Had she disclosed the issues prior to the booking, I wouldn't have booked the apartment and found accommodations elsewhere.  I told her of the poor air circulation in the apartment (the living room has no ac), and it took her a week to get a fan in the apartment.  After requesting a minor price adjustment for the inconvenience (I paid over 4k for the entire rental, I requested $500), she came up with issues that were never reported prior:  a broken sofa, smoking in the apartment, spray paint on a wall (over $1,100 in damages).  She visited the apartment twice during the duration of the stay- once was planned in advance, the other was unplanned (she stopped by the business to pick up keys), and maintenance was in the apartment twice: none of the issues the materialized after my partial refund request were found.  She said that she did not check the apartment prior to agreeing to the reservation, which is why she did not disclose the leak in advance, so I'm assuming the noted damages were there before the guests arrived.  I did not see any of the smoke issues and the guests did not report any damage to the apartment when I picked them up to go to the apartment.  Overall, definitely not a pleasant experience.  I've done several bookings for work and personal events, and this was by far the worst.  The guests also told me of pest control issues after their stay (I didn't see anything when I dropped them off and picked them up, but I wasn't looking for that and was there briefly).  The only pro: the location of the apartment."
4239,652635,2020-01-03,"Clean, tidy accommodation, good facilities and easy check in/out"
4240,715189,2021-08-03,"Shelleys flat was absolutely amazing! She has a big comfy couch and had some snacks and drinks waiting for me on my arrival. The bed was clean and comfortable. It was every thing and more, a perfect stay!! Highly recommended!"

4256,548336,2019-09-20,My favorite host to stay with when I am in the city for work! Victoria is wonderful!
4257,720233,2020-02-16,Place was amazing highly recommend
4258,742645,2019-06-26,"Susan’s place is a good choice if you like Brooklyn. It is not too far from Manhattan (25 mins subway) but the subway station is within walking distance. Area is safe. However, the apartment is in the basement so the entrance puts me down a bit.<br/>Alesh is very communicative and I would recommend this place."
4259,780953,2021-10-18,Great area to walk around bars/restaraunts as well as huge outdoor area
4260,827062,2021-03-21,service was great! place was exactly as expected and 24/7 service to host was definitely a plus!
4261,158518,2019-07-24,Great location for the train. If you need a place just to crash and take showers this is perfect. Nice tv too
4262,888858,2021-11-22,"Samuel was a great host, and the space was better than we expected ! Perfectly close to two different subways that went all over NYC."
4263,421215,2019-07-29,"A small, quiet little place that’s very clean with a great host!"
4264,469203,2019-05-07,Paige’s place was perfect for our weekend stay in NYC. The location was great and it was easy to get to wherever we wanted to go. And the terrace was incredible - definitely our favorite part.
4265,93214,2019-10-21,Rosa was very kind! Astoria is always my fav location to stay in!
4266,721575,2019-08-31,Ollie is a tremendous host! Answered all the questions that I had and provides a great manual to the house and area for quests staying in the apartment!
4267,744624,2019-06-21,"This is a stylish and advanced apartment, which is a great location to go to a lot of restaurants, bars, 24H stores and supermarkets around the area. And this area is quiet, you can walk to the subway about 10 minutes. This is my second live this apartment , I love this apartment it like my home, I hope to come back again."
4268,402442,2020-02-19,Thanks for having us will come again
4269,490708,2019-11-14,"Excelente lugar, Juan es muy servicial, soluciona problemas inmediatamente, el lugar es muy limpio y con mucha privacidad tal como se describe."
4270,879241,2021-09-01,"Nice place, if you decide to cancel, don’t!  You will get less than 1/5th back of what you payed.  Regardless of reason"
4271,709258,2019-04-21,A hidden gem. Comparable to a 5* hotel. Beautiful
4272,518151,2019-06-24,"Akiko is a very welcoming, friendly host. The room is spacious, comfortable, and very private. The apartment is in a quiet area and very close to the Broadway metro stop, a very short metro ride to Manhattan. Plenty of nice eateries and supermarkets nearby so you can get everything you need. Highly recommended, would definitely stay here again!"
4273,88497,2019-11-07,"This is the coziest home-away-from-home you can find on airbnb. The apartment is comfortable and just as described, with everything you could want or need. Perfect for families with teens & tweens - there are books & boardgames which totally pleased my 11 year old. Fantastic location close to the subway & wonderful local cafes. Perfectly clean & tidy. Roslyn is a warm & welcoming host. I'd be thrilled to stay here again."
4274,333152,2021-09-10,I love absolutely love D and her home. The hospitality and comfort of place made me feel like I was literally at home. She made my stay really nice and I felt welcomed and comfortable while traveling alone. Her dogs are everything and I love them to pieces. Thanks again D.
4275,800517,2020-11-08,"Great place. Great location. No window with a great view ...but, instead, a private bathroom attached to the bedroom! Bed, bathroom and towels were clean. Hieu & David obviously put in effort to their hosting and you can sense that. Smooth experience all around. Thank you!"
4276,678647,2019-05-01,"Quiet and calm neighborhood. Spacious bedroom ,well stocked kitchen with multicultural foods beverages seasonings and good bathroom. Comfortable living room with a TV set. Very clean environment and the hosts will keep checking on you daily to ensure that you are comfortable."
4277,546458,2019-04-22,Jeremiah’s place is very homey and clean. I felt as if I was staying over a family members house. The parking in the neighborhood is good as well I had no issues. I will definitely return to his home during any future trips.
4278,782005,2020-02-10,"10 out of 10 stars for my recent stay at Jenifer's place. I do believe this was my favorite airbnb experience to date! The space itself is immaculate and very stylish (I love the clean minimalist look...very relaxing after busy days running around the city!). I appreciated thoughtful touches like fresh lit candles in the common areas at check in--smelled amazing and felt like arriving home.<br/><br/>If you have to choose any room, choose the master bedroom. The space is massive--we were two and had plenty of room to spare and had our own separate beds to sleep on (one a queen, the other a twin). Also having your own bathroom and facing the backyard instead of the street is a major plus (though the other rooms are cute too and I don't think noise would be an issue as it's not a very noisy street) <br/><br/>Jenifer is a super friendly, responsible and responsive hostess. Any questions or concerns that came up in the days leading up to and during the stay were addressed immediately! Check-in was a breeze and I was graciously allowed to keep my luggage in the space before check in since I arrived early. <br/><br/>The neighborhood itself felt safe (we walked to a nearby eatery at night) and at times felt almost residential considering you're in Crown Heights. You're a very short walk away from the C line and convenient bus stops. There are plenty of restaurants and grocery stores within walking distance as well. Did I mention the space was beautiful and spotless? I was very impressed and will definitely be booking here again the next time I'm in Brooklyn! Gracias Jenifer <3"
4279,418813,2019-05-12,"Great location, quick responses to questions, friendly."
4280,462973,2020-02-21,"It was what I expected. Her description of the place is pretty accurate. Also, it was easy to communicate with Eun M. Thanks Eun!"
4281,645296,2021-06-01,"Tina's setup is very cool, very Brooklyn. Many interesting, affordable, and good restaurants, groceries, and entertainment spots are nearby in Bushwick. Having the L train 5 minutes away is totally convenient. Tina made me feel welcome. Her flat feels like a garden with all its plants. She's very fastidious and her flat is clean and neat. My accommodation space was a little tight but just right for one person. I would definitely stay there again."
4282,831295,2021-09-09,Nice place easy check in
4283,735944,2020-06-22,This place is very amazing.. love the area and the rooms were nice and the bathroom omg lived the Bluetooth mirror I had a whole concert in the shower lol parking was easy to find and I needed a extra hour before check out I contacted the host to ask within 10 minutes they answered fast and gave me that extra hour with no problem I highly recommend this place A1 hospitality and the neighbors are very nice ppl.
4284,598682,2019-12-27,great location with easy access to midtown.  The place was so spacious we had our family Xmas celebration for 10!  Asia provided helpful information about the area and was always available for questions!  Loved our stay
4285,884289,2021-10-02,"I love this place. Very comfortable and relaxing, I’ll be back . Lol"
4286,685139,2021-07-01,"I had a really good experience with Etna. Her house is very clean and the other room in Airbnb is a dream. Although, the section I rented from her in her living room is not as  dreamy. The main problem is that the only ventilation system is a door to a little patio. Everyone that lives in NYC knows that to have a window open without a net to protect from undesirable bug visitors during night time is a risk nobody wants to take. This room does not provide that, basic ventilation. This probably is not a problem in winter, but in summer is important to notice. Also, every communication I had with  Edna felt honest and in agreement, but after an unfortunate bug accident that Airbnb mediated she decided that I was a lier and that I brought the problem home and has sent me really rude messages. The reality is that I found two really small crockraches, one dead, and one alive, and a middle side one crawling on my leg one night. And I have a lot of bug phobia. Not welcoming that part of my experience, and the rude messages afterwards. Having bugs in the city in the summer is not something very rare, but it is up to the host to protect the house as good as possible."
4287,737215,2020-08-21,This place was soo amazing. My boyfriend and I spent it here for a surprise birthday gateway I had planned for us. Tene was extremely nice by letting my friends come in and decorate the place. It was truly an amazing time!
4288,722897,2019-11-20,"Paola and Florentina were great hosts! The room was clean, comfortable and inviting. Communication was clear and quick, and the location is great. Even when we overslept and were late checking out, Florentina was gracious and understanding. She even offered us a coffee! We would absolutely stay here again."
4289,700114,2021-09-06,What a beautiful place. Truly felt like home. Would definitely stay there again in the future. Thank you for the lovely place.
4290,530580,2020-01-06,Not the biggest space. But if you’re looking for a place to crash and be close to transportation at a low price this is a great place for you.
4291,596495,2019-11-03,"We had a wonderful stay at Kaiti's apartment which is very stylish and comfortable- even nicer than the photographs! Although we arrived quite late in the evening Kaiti was there to settle us in and answer any questions. She made local recommendations such as the Apollo amateur night which was fantastic and very good value-a definite thing you should do in Harlem. The large apartment slept 4 of us comfortably and was spotlessly clean. The area is  great with a supermarket close by and lovely coffee shops. It was only a short walk to the subway and then about 15 minutes to Downtown so overall was a super location. We really felt we were living like New Yorkers for a week, and one evening a film crew was filming Law and Order on a street nearby which was very exciting! I would thoroughly recommend this apartment; Kaiti was a fantastic host who communicated promptly with us and was very helpful. Hopefully we will return one day!"
4292,469308,2019-02-27,"Location! This apartment is in a terrific location!  Close to everything, charming and safe.  Couldn’t ask for more.<br/>Be aware, this is a 3rd floor walkup and the staircase is relatively narrow.  Not that I overpacked and had to muscle my giant suitcase up/down the stairs...<br/>Anyway, this place is great and I would (er, *will*) definitely come back.  One thing to note, you can hear the hum of chatter from the restaurant below but it was one of my favorite parts of staying here.  The place just feels so alive and well lived in.  Already planning my next visit!"
4293,180672,2019-07-22,"We loved our stay here. The apartment was exactly as described - in fact if anything it felt slightly more spacious than I'd expected. It was also in a great part of Brooklyn with loads of nice bars and restaurants, and convenient transport links to the rest of the city. Check in was a breeze too. Would definitely recommend this place."
4294,576471,2020-09-20,"Timo is very friendly person. He predicted every question that you can have about apartment, there are instructions everywhere. Apartment has amazing design  with a lot of details, location is excellent too, there are a lot of subway stations nearby."
4295,438452,2019-01-17,"I really enjoyed staying at Mark and Will’s place. They were nice, friendly and very responsive. Nice location which is only 5-6mims walk to the 1 line subway station. I was alone traveling around so that the location was perfect for me. Also their 2dogs are so cute, if you are a dog lover must be visiting their 2 lovely dogs. <br/>Once again thanks to them ! Mark is a great host I will definitely recommend this place !"
4296,217898,2021-10-28,"Had a great stay here! Perfect for a couple, in such a great part of Brooklyn with easy access to transit and restaurants. Communication and checking in and out were effortless."
4297,856353,2021-11-27,Devon was very responsive and the airbnb had pretty much everything you need. Would definitely come again!
4298,630434,2020-01-01,Lovely comfortable space. Great location. Would definitely recommend
4299,872697,2021-11-29,Super clean and great base for exploring!
4300,641217,2019-09-11,"Ryan is very friendly and so is his cat. A great stay, will definitely come back."
4301,419783,2020-05-13,"The upstairs neighbors are a bit noisy which made it difficult to sleep. Was an issue for me because i had early wakes up for work. There was a dog running around up there too. Also, the pots and pans were rusty and very beat up. I ended up buying my own. Otherwise Cliff was attentive and responded quickly to my messages"
4302,632537,2019-12-06,"the host is very nice. it is very easy to access the train station. shops, banks, many restaurants close by. It was a pleasure to stay there. I will definitely return back to same place."
4303,572373,2019-09-02,The apartment was very comfortable and clean and was located in the  perfect location  for our stay. It was very accessible to the subway. Brennan and Nubia were quick to respond and were very welcoming and accommodating.
4304,803175,2021-11-07,"Great spot in the Bronx with easy access to everything the area offers. Lauren was very accommodating and all of the information she provided was clear, accurate and helpful. I’d definitely recommend staying if you’re considering this option."
4305,635391,2019-06-13,"Hilary’s place is in a great location, close to many restaurants and stores. The neighborhood is beautiful and really close to the subway to Manhattan, which we took every day during our stay. For a family of four, it offered the space to eat breakfast together every morning and to rest after a long day of sightseeing. The apartment was very spacious and comfortable for our little family. Would highly recommend staying at Hilary’s place!"
4306,579356,2019-12-30,"Very basic room, almost completely filled by the bed and a table (not much space to move inside the room), good for short stays. I did not take the measurement for the bed but I am sure the bed I have at home is a standard queen size (60''x80'') and the bed in Simone's room was smaller.<br/>The position is convenient, as explained in the advertisement is easy to get central Manhattan by the metro, and Simone was very flexible for the check-in time. <br/>The main remark I want to make is about the condition of the apartment: in general is quite clean, apart from some small spots, but it is quite untidy/neglected and a bit stuffy, which makes the stay less enjoyable. However, since we only had to sleep there, and considering the prices around the area, it was ok."
4307,889637,2021-11-26,Crystal's place is great for those visiting Bronx. The room is clean and well prepared. A few minutes to the subway station.
4308,424057,2021-10-12,"Aracelis and her husband were both great hosts! The room was just like the pictures, we were very comfortable, had plenty of privacy and was only a short walk away from the metro! 100% recommended!"
4309,180794,2020-03-24,"Petya is very flexible. We had to change the reservation due to COVID-19, and she was very understanding and let us made the change."
4310,680988,2020-02-02,"Great hosts,  clean and nice place."
4311,720300,2019-10-24,"El apartamento está impecable, muy cerca del transporte público y en una zona con movimiento de gente."

4314,650167,2021-06-06,"Great space , quiet neighborhood. Host is great with communication"
4315,820288,2020-07-29,This is the best place to stay (quality/price) in NYC. The owners are very responsible and we much appreciated the late checkout. Thank you so much. Best
4316,780931,2019-10-14,"Brooke’s apartment is a fantastic and tasteful place! We loved it and will be happy to stay there again. The location of the apartment is very convenient and is in the very fun and nice area. Next door is a nice vegetarian restaurant, the area is full of cool cafes, bars & restaurants. Pretty safe, many groceries and drugstores around. You will definitely enjoy."
4317,676368,2019-09-29,Mr Thomas is a great man. His appartment is clean and comfortable. Thomas is always available for responding.
4318,818287,2020-11-19,"From the moment we booked Trey and Alexis, my experience was outstanding! This place is exactly how it’s pictured and is really nice from the decor to how it’s built. The backyard was beautiful as well, as there was a really nice area for us to sit in. Even though it’s on the basement level I didn’t experience any issues you might normally experience (cold, bugs, etc.) We arrived a bit early and Trey was kind enough to let us drop our luggage off while we went to get food. Overall this was a great experience and I look forward to booking with them in the future!"
4319,858850,2021-10-31,"Room was just what we needed for our trip.  Clean, safe and simple.  Would stay there again.  Host was available for any questions.  Answered inquires quickly during our stay."
4320,581939,2019-09-11,Great stay. The place is around 30 minutes from downtown with lots of trains nearby. The place has everything you need for a short stay and it was self check in.
4321,575183,2019-12-13,"The apartment is huge, especially for a studio! It has a full kitchen, dining space, tv with Apple TV, large couch and comfortable bed. The bathroom is newly renovated too. It takes about 10-12 minutes to walk to the R/M subway station and about 15-17 min to get to the large station with connections to Q, E, 7, etc. (The walk wasn’t an issue for me, but it may be a trek for some.)<br/><br/>Room for improvement: the heater had issues most of my stay. When it was on, it would make extremely loud banging noises periodically, some of which were so loud that it woke me up, even while wearing earplugs (which were very kindly provided by the hosts). It’s not their fault and the hosts were great about quickly responding to the issue by trying to fix it themselves, but I think there’s a bigger problem that needs to be looked at by a professional. I’ve lived in NYC apartments with noisy radiators, but this was extreme. I ended up just turning the heat off or all the way down to 67 and bundling up in blankets, which I don’t really mind. Weirdly though, the hosts asked me to “please keep the heat below 75 degrees” as it was making the upstairs extremely hot, even though I had the thermostat very low. Lastly, I had to put some papers over the glass windows on the doors for some privacy. It just felt exposed when you can see directly into the apartment from outside either door, especially with neighbors close by."
4322,661927,2021-07-02,"Pro: Vanessa was super nice and communication was never a problem. The location is close to lots of restaurants. The entire loft was so beautiful and I loved the decorations. <br/><br/>Cons: Parking can be a little bit of a problem during rush hours. If you are from the suburbs, Brooklyn might look a little weird based on the surroundings and the old buildings. There are two flights of stairs before you get to the actual loft."
4323,622764,2019-05-21,Good location to yankee Stadium about 15 /20 min walk the corner store there has awsome food the place has a cozy home feel
4324,801261,2020-07-05,"Great space. Warm and cozy. Very clean and homey feel. Great area with plenty of restaurants, bars and stores. 5 min walk to the trains and 5 stops away from Manhattan. Definitely would go back."
4325,808843,2020-08-01,"When I walked in, it was beautiful. Melissa and her husband were very attentive and responsive & I loved that. They are the sweetest people. The bed was so comfortable, the duvet cover is so warm ( my boyfriend sleeps with the ac on ) a There’s a great view of the city and the lights on the bridge at night. There’s a lot of places to eat around ( driving and walking distance ). It was hard to choose just one. My honey says that has to be our go-to spot. While on FaceTime with my friends, they kept asking  me send them the link so they can book in the future as well lol"
4326,692432,2019-06-16,"Siji was an amazing host. Her responses were very quick, accurate and detailed. Her place is comfy, and clean. This is just a personal experience I had but I had a car with me and parking was hard to find in the area especially getting back later at night when parking was basically full. That was the only down side that I should have planned better. Also the neighbourhood is a bit loud even at night but Siji was thoughtful and provided earplugs. She truly tries accommodating for the aspects she can’t control. I appreciated it."
4327,858780,2021-09-14,Great place to stay if you want to explore outside of Manhattan. Everything you may need is close by from CVS to local deli’s. The space was very clean and organized. Great deal for the price and both Rudy and Ernie are excellent hosts!
4328,162043,2019-09-08,"Great, comfortable stay. Good communication! 10/10 would stay again."
4329,62974,2019-03-28,"I had a great stay with Melanie in Harlem. The apt is walking distance to everything you need, super clean, and located right on the subway. Melanie was easy to communicate with and responded right away to any questions I had. Would definitely stay here again!"
4330,538116,2019-01-06,Perfect
4331,372343,2019-03-31,Jamie’s apartment was very comfy and with a perfect location for us!
4332,714683,2021-08-31,"Amazing place to stay, quiet, spacious, super clean, great lighting and very nicely decorated. There is an awesome desk to work remote from so it was perfect for me. I have stayed at many AirBNBs in the area and this is by far the best one. So close to the park and the MET. The kitchen was a big plus for me for my extended stay. I highly recommend this apartment if you are looking for a comfortable stay in the Upper East Side, I even extended my stay I enjoyed it so much. I will definitely stay again."
4333,761335,2020-10-24,great stay
4334,672926,2019-09-09,Lana's place is very convenient. It is located in Lower East side near SOHO. Subway station is also a few block away. The house is very clean and tidy including kitchen and bathroom. Lana is very kind and welcoming. Lana's place is highly recommended.
4335,880808,2021-11-29,This was a bright and airy home. Communication with the host was top notch. Everything was exactly as described. The home was very clean and comfortable with plenty of room for our girls trip!
4336,752175,2019-10-24,Great place. Great location. Would definitely stay here again.
4337,547591,2019-04-09,"Very spacious place with everything you could possibly need! Location is amazing and I have absolutely no complaints! Definitely recommending this to everyone, would come again :-)"
4338,471470,2019-10-10,Centralized location safe and super clean<br/>Don’t expect luxury its a sensible place for a single man or couple
4339,25437,2021-10-31,Nice convenient location and Chris was very accoomodating.
4340,539875,2020-08-23,It was nice
4341,183227,2019-05-22,"Location can't be beat! Extremely safe and secure building. Quiet, respectful host"
4342,854507,2021-05-02,"Pros:<br/>- great location (walking distance to Empire State Building, Koreatown, Time Squares, etc.) <br/>- very clean<br/>- quick response from hosts<br/>- contactless check-in <br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- no free parking spot with the hotel but there is metered parking and parking garage nearby (just a bit expensive)"
4343,565666,2021-07-13,"I stayed at Karen's place for about a month and Karen was a great host. She responded to any questions and concerns I had in a timely manner, and she let me know about any issues in a timely manner as well. For example, there was a brief internet shortage and she was kind enough to let me know about it immediately and keep me updated. Great host, great location, and a great stay."
4344,359403,2021-07-13,"I don't know how I was so lucky to have booked Katherine's place. First off, if you love animals you will love her cats. I took care of the cats for a week while Katherine went upstate to her tiny home, so I essentially had the full apartment to myself. If that interests you in the summer, you should message her about the details. When Katherine was at the place, she was incredibly easy-going and always willing to chat. <br/><br/>I also want to mention that if you are a young working professional trying to move to New York, this place checks off ALL of the boxes for a launchpad. It's in the heart of the East Village, which is certainly wild at times, but definitely central to the action. The room is right at the entrance of the apartment so you won't bother Katherine or the cats on your way in. It has a giant desk with excellent internet coverage and is right next to the AC . The bed and desk are separated by a wall that essentially divides the room. Overall for the value, an excellent choice for anyone who is trying to work while finding an apartment."
4345,662043,2019-08-15,"Excellent location on the Upper East Side!  Just two blocks away from the Q subway in a neighborhood with lots of restaurants (don't miss the ice cream at the sweet shop), a convenient grocery, and a 15 minute walk to some of the most beautiful parts of Central Park.  The apartment is a very comfortable size for a Manhattan one bedroom and even worked well when my aunt joined me for several days. The pull-out couch came in handy then!  Lots of storage/closet space and a Roku if you want to watch TV after a busy day exploring the city.<br/><br/>Zach was a great host, providing tips about the area and always responding quickly to any questions or concerns, and he was incredibly gracious when he had to let me in again after I accidentally locked the keys in the apartment.  This is a great city apartment for a single person or a couple.  It has a few foibles like any New York apartment (the door to the bedroom catches on the bed and doesn't easily close all the way, you have to walk through the bedroom to get to the bathroom, and it is a second floor walk-up so anyone with trouble with stairs might have issues), but it's a fantastic value and a fabulous Manhattan location.  Overall a smooth, very positive experience.  I would definitely consider it for my next trip to the city."
4346,671187,2019-10-08,"A cozy, cute room with lots of character packed into a smaller space. But the size of the room didn't matter when there was a comfy bed, a multitude of teas, and other amenity items. Would definitely go back again. Had a small photoshoot there as well and it was perfect, especially when able to control the lights."
4347,211022,2019-06-24,"Recommended!! Harlem's the place to be, and the apartment is in a great part of it, ideal for the subway (5 mins walk from lines B/C  and 2/3 at 135th, both taking you to the hub bub of downtown touristland in 15-20 mins). You can also reach the northern side of Central Park (the better side, IMO) by foot in 20 mins. The apartment has everything you need, inc breakfast to get you going, tea, coffee, etc. No need to buy things like salt, foil, ice, etc. as it's all there. The space is great, the bed is super comfy, the AC units in both the lounge and bedroom work really well -  a godsend when it was 27C and even more so when it was 90%+ humidity. The bedroom's at the back of the house so although the building is on a main avenue, weekend mornings are especially quiet. (I am a v light sleeper, but used earplugs just once during a 5-night stay, on a Weds night.) Lots of fantastic food options nearby (loved Yatenga, Jacobs, Sotto Casa, Sugar Hill Creamery but there's a ton of others!) as well as small grocery stores and a superior supermarket a 10-min stroll away at 145th. The shower works well, plenty of hanging space in the wardrobe, a range of toiletries in the bathroom, TV's fairly easy to navigate.  Also close to the Schumberg Center, also the meet-up point for Harlem walking tours - good to find out more about the rich history of this area and the stories behind the lovely homes and churches."
4348,505663,2019-09-06,"This was the best air bnb we have stayed in - hands down! The location just could not be beaten- the street was quiet and safe but a stones throw from the action if you wanted it! There were so many lovely touches including a food basket, umbrellas (for those unexpected NY showers). We loved the sheer number of amazing restaurants on our doorstep. We both really felt comfortable and at ‘home’ in NY. About a million times lovelier than staying in a cramped NY hotel. thanks Lena"
4349,829270,2021-05-20,"Miao was a great host, I would come back 100%!"
4350,282496,2019-10-23,"The place was perfect, the room was great, Brady was very helpful and she responded very quick when I had a query. The location was perfect for us, close to Manhattan and in the same line to the JFK Airport. Totally recommend it!!"
4351,676271,2019-05-26,"Great first trip to NYC staying at Dawa and Phurpas place in Jackson heights. We were weary of how hard it would be to get to manhattan each day, but it wasn’t hard with the subway. Expect about a 10 minute walk followed by a 30 minute ride on the subway but then you’re in the city for the whole day, their price is very fair when considering this. The Jackson heights area isn’t bad either and also has some things to offer. Would highly recommend to a younger couple or guests looking to have the whole New York experience. Place is as advertised."

4356,745829,2019-12-17,Good place to stay in a pinch. Bed was super comfy. If you are doing a day trip however be sure to pay attention to the check-in/check-out times as you'll only have 15 hours stay (basically to sleep).

4359,569860,2019-10-27,"Houman's place was in a great location, only minutes away from the subway station. Even though he was not able to physically meet, check in was a breeze through the lockbox. I was surprised by how spacious the studio was and it was very well designed."
4360,662989,2019-05-01,"Very relaxed atmosphere inside and outside the house, nice spacious room with good beds, beautiful wooden floor and clean private bathroom. Roommates are lovely people and so is the cat! My sons and me had a fantastic time."

We loved Mesa Coyoacan. Her place was really nice and spacious. We felt right at home. And the snacks, wine and coffee were welcoming too. We would absolutely stay here again in NYC."
4362,808530,2020-05-26,This is definitely a great place to stay while visiting the city! Times Square is blocks away. The apartment is just steps away from so many restaurants and bars. I would recommend this place to anyone! The host Paul was very kind and helpful!

There are many restaurants near-by and also neighborhood grocery stores that are within a short walking distance. Also, the subway is only a few blocks away that will take you anywhere in Manhatten that you want to go (or anywhere else, for that matter). I loved running in Prospect Park! Fabulous place for long runs! Lots of other runners, bikers, walkers! And, closed to automobile traffic in much of the park."

4372,363958,2019-10-19,"This place is perfect to discover upper Manhatten. Just a few minutes to Time Square, Penn Station, HighLine and Hudson yards. The studio should be big enough for two persons (I compare it to the hotel rooms I had in the past with the advantage of having a kitchen and fridge). I would book this place again."
4373,887105,2021-10-16,Trey's place was a great getaway after being around in Manhattan all day! The location was convenient and close to the subway and we would definitely be happy to stay there again the next time we visit!!

Inacio is a true sweetheart and an absolute professional, committed to ensuring that his guests have everything they need for a smooth, comfortable, stay. <br/><br/>I'm so  glad I found and booked this place.  A true gem in the heart of West Harlem/Hamilton Heights on the UWS, the unit is conveniently located to almost everything that makes Manhattan living great: 2 mins from the 1 train; a nice walking distance to all the shopping areas you could ask for (from Wholefoods, to Starbucks, DSW, H&M etc etc); close to Columbia and Barnard University; nice running trails around Riverside Drive, Morningside Drive, etc.; local and affordable Hamilton Heights eateries like Fumo, and a ton more. Literally something for everyone. <br/><br/>Highly recommend and would happily and repeatedly book here again without hesitation. Obrigado, Inacio! : )"

4384,491091,2020-01-11,"Jia’s as the host was very helpful and always replied if needed. We did not need that much of help, but everything was very thoughtful. We were near some great street food and to get food it would be maybe less than a 5 min walk. This place is pretty close to a subway to get to the city, but if don’t want to go to the city staying in the area you’ll be so full of great food and great shopping complex. This was my significant others first time in New York and she loved it. Will come back."
4385,398347,2020-11-14,"A great place to stay in the center of Brooklyn where everything is available to you and easy transportation to Manhattan. Very clean and super easy check in.

4391,511800,2019-03-21,"Marlyn’s home was excellent and clean, both her and her husband were very hospitable. I would definitely book one of their properties again :) - only gripe is it would have been good to have an extra set of keys as the two of us staying were often out separately!"

4398,890215,2021-11-03,"Grant and their roommate hosted my uncle and his partner who were visiting NYC for a few days. Travel during COVID complicated my uncle's visit, he was delayed at the airport and his previous stop because of mandatory testing. He was forced to check-in a whole day and half late and had to book an extra night last minute. While my uncle did not qualify for a partial refund for the first night's cancelation, Grant stayed up waiting for my uncle pass 1am on the second night, which was very kind of him. In terms of location, the apartment is located perpendicular to City College and above St. Nicholas Park. It's an easy walk, downhill to the express 145th street stations (ABCD trains) as well as the local 135th street station (BC trains). the stations are down the hill (and therefore uphill on your way back). The walks to the 137th and 145th street stations for the 1 train are not as steep and an option, especially if you're visiting the Lincoln Center ... location and the space are perfect for people who will be traveling around NYC. I high recommend this place and will be sending my family here when they visit me!"

Between the cleanliness, awesome location with tons of great places to check out nearby, and the comfort of the space, it's definitely a 5 star Airbnb.  If I could, I would give Pietro 6 stars for his hosting because he accommodated our requests to drop off our luggage early and was very responsive with any questions we had.  Definitely a place worth returning to when I'm in NYC again!"

4431,793475,2021-10-07,"The apartment was well equipped and located in a quiet area. Hosts were really kind and attentive about my needs. However, I felt this was a bit too expensive for what I experienced. It was further from JFK than described. Lastly, I felt a bit constrained because of the extensive house manual compared to other stays. Again, I know every host has a different way of managing their property but I’m trying to be as honest as possible."
4432,595492,2020-05-31,"Really enjoyed my stay. Very attentive hosts, I would definitely recommend booking with them."
4433,766646,2021-02-25,"Adam's place was very well located for our purposes as we needed to be close to our daughter's apartment in Spencer Street Brooklyn.  The subway, supermarket, bagel place and Fan Fan donuts and good coffee at Stonefruit, were a short walk away.  The bed is very comfortable and the kitchen was adequate. The bathroom was awkward and ice-cold in February, however this would be a good base for a stay in Brooklyn at this price-point."
4434,35033,2019-12-21,Everything was like we hoped. Calm place and great location! Thanks for everything!
4435,799369,2021-10-12,"Amazing location on a pretty block. Clean, looks just like the pictures. Great communication & easy check in. The only thing that would make this apartment perfect is more natural light… but there is an outdoor space to help make up for that. Would definitely recommend!"
4436,630660,2019-08-11,Trinity’s apartment was a great place for us to stay for 7 days. It is 5 streets from the subway and a direct metro to Times Square and other places in midtown. The room was a good size (especially for New York) and we could fit both our open suitcases in comfortably. Very comfortable bed too! Would highly recommend
4437,491560,2019-05-30,"Zee was a great host! Very polite and helpful. The room was very nice, clean and comfortable. Fantastic location. Friendly (and safe) neighborhood close to subway. There was also close everything that we needed: restaurants, shops, bakeries, laundry, pubs, etc. We would like to stay next time."
4438,847913,2021-08-07,"Suprised that the room is an actually an apartment type because there’s a mini kitchen with fridge and stove, and dining area. I wanted to extend my stay but another guests would be checking in. Place is also so quiet. <br/><br/>Host is responsive and accommodating. <br/>I had a great stay!"
4439,509500,2019-01-07,This place is a must! Outstanding value and Camilla is an amazing host. The place is “to die for” cute and the location was perfect for my needs. I will definitely book again!
4440,843252,2021-02-15,"Tamara's place for me is in the best part of the city! It's close to all of the restaurants, bars and shopping that I love. It's a walkable distance if you want to go anywhere else downtown. The check-in and check-out were super seamless. And there's an elevator so easy for us to get our luggage to the 4th floor. The interior has really cool art and sort of a minimalist colorful vibe, which i thought was super cool and the entire place was very clean! I'd definitely recommend her place :)"

4442,871289,2021-10-24,"I was traveling solo and stayed here for an evening. I had a great experience! <br/><br/>The apartment and room are extremely clean, well-kept, and very comfortable.  Communication and coordination with Burak was seamless, and he is very good at responding to messages quickly, which I really appreciated as I coordinated my stay rather last minute.<br/><br/>The location of the apartment is excellent, with the subway and lots of great grocery stores, coffee shops, and restaurants nearby. Everything you need is within a very reasonable walking distance. I'd absolutely come back here again! Thanks Burak for a great stay."

4448,731989,2019-07-16,"This was such a great home to stay in. Very laid back hosts, with great communication skills. Traveling is very easy from their place, really close to the C and A train. Lots of culture in the neighborhood, and shopping is easy. I will say, if you're going to the city, take all the things you will need with you that day, because it's a long trip back (even if you take the express train), and traveling back and forth will be a hassle. Besides that - I loved the place!"
4449,801380,2021-09-26,"best part about the place is location. we stayed here during bachelorette party and had 5 people in this room and 5 in another room in the same building. it's just three beds and a tiny tiny bathroom basically. so really bare bones. it worked fine for us, especially since all our plans were in Koreatown/midtown. didnt love the space that much in terms of comfort and convenience (bathroom size is really small but there are communal bathrooms on the same floor), shower curtain rod fell off the hinges by day 2. overall it was nothing fancy but fulfilled the purpose for our weekend."
4450,558826,2020-10-26,"Very pleasant place, clean"
4451,628518,2019-07-07,"Great location for the whole of Brooklyn, most sites within walking distance. Amazing view of the water only 15 minute walk away. 2 minute walk to the subway that leads you right into the centre of Manhattan. Great area full of cool shops and amazing food. The apartment of very homely and full of little amenities such as books on the local area and many maps as well as a guide written by Ashley. Midori the cat is the sweetest. Would recommend."
4452,385455,2019-03-16,Michael and Sharon were great hosts. The place was as described. Easy access to train. Good locale. And Michael served me a great welcome home burger. Thanks again for letting me stay at your place.
4453,666959,2019-05-17,"Tricia's place was great -- very clean, stylishly decorated, and comfortable. The location was perfect for me, as I was doing work at the Schomburg Center and this place was within easy walking distance. Check-in was easy, and the apartment is totally private. I would definitely stay here again."
4454,122249,2020-07-10,Nice cozy room!
4455,638294,2021-10-12,Very nice and spacious well accommodated basement studio apartment with separate entrance.  Great queen bed and extra futon bed.  Well equipped kitchen.  Very comfortable.  Very helpful host.
4456,868835,2021-09-21,Hernry es muy amable y siempre presto a atender las necesidades de sus huéspedes.
4457,858703,2021-10-04,"Great place and location! Stayed in New York for a few days with my girlfriend and we both loved it! The space was as described and we liked all the decorations. Everyone at the front desk was very helpful and attentive to us. We had a few questions about the place and the communication was excellent. The location is very lively during the day and in the evening. However, the place was very quiet, which we also appreciated. Overall, I was happy with my choice and will certainly look to stay here the next time I'm in NY. Thank you!!"
4458,539553,2020-03-08,"Great space for sleep and two people. Clean bathroom for a shared space. Marvelous neighborhood and people, so don’t be ignorant."
4459,519790,2019-10-29,"The loft was very nice and the beds were actually very comfortable! It was a great space, and Dan was always quick to respond to any questions we had!"
4460,582185,2020-01-01,Clean and friendly
4461,807297,2020-03-31,Nice warm cozy place.
4462,868256,2021-06-14,Very fair price and close to the best attractions of the area
4463,649350,2019-12-11,"Julie is a responsive and accommodating host. Place was welcoming, convenient, and affordable. I would recommend to anyone who needs a place to crash in Brooklyn."
4464,842666,2021-08-04,"Nice little apartment on the UES. Very quiet with lots of room for suitcases, etc. The location was great for us with lots of restaurants nearby. Aleftina was very responsive."
4465,724108,2019-05-21,Very nice place
4466,849749,2021-02-20,As always a perfect place to go this my second time here and I'll go again
4467,687078,2019-03-25,"There are so many good things to say about this space that it would take pages to sing all its praises, so I will stick to three main things.  First, the host, Linda, is by far the friendliest, most accommodating, warmest person you will ever meet.  She was always available by phone or in person for any questions or needs.  Second...  trust me on this - you will NOT find a place anywhere in NYC with the kind of charm, character and unique touches found here.  It is like walking into a long forgotten NY - interesting details, art, books, paintings, and architecture make you feel almost as if you are staying in a guest house at the Vanderbilt Mansion.  If you like vintage, old world charm, you will fall in love.  I mean...there's a fireplace in the room!  And finally... the place is located maybe three blocks from the heart of the Lower East Side nightlife and restaurant scene.  No lengthy Uber rides necessary to get to all the action that downtown has to offer.  I highly recommend a stay here.  You can't go wrong."
4468,846454,2021-03-13,Alinca’s Place was very nice and warm welcomed
4469,881261,2021-11-15,"Katia is a warm, excellent host. The place is clean, safe, and decorated nicely. Would very much recommend."
4470,800776,2021-10-13,"We really appreciated the place and loved how easy it was to come and go out of. It was beautiful and comfortable, perfect balance. Stefan’s place had everything we needed. Would definitely stay there again. <br/><br/>The location was great for our family (including a 4 and 5 year old)! Right between Chinatown and Little Italy we popped down for dinner or dessert most nights after bouncing around the city all day. <br/><br/>With kids, found that we could do go out in the morning (statue of Liberty, Brooklyn bridge, etc) and then come back for a rest before going out uptown later on (Central Park, Times Square, etc). We had a blast and having a great home base was crucial."
4471,658797,2019-02-15,Omar is a really cool dude. Communication was easy with him and he’ll check in with you to make sure that you’re as comfortable as possible. Definitely would stay there again!
4472,121962,2021-11-24,Excellent room! Great access to a kitchen and Carlene was so great about communicating with us. Thanks!
4473,843438,2021-04-17,Easy access to the subway
4474,139559,2021-07-07,"Our family stayed here for several nights while visiting people in NYC. 4 adults stayed comfortably here in the two double beds. The pictures in the listing are accurate, the noise level is what one might expect for living in NYC, the building felt safe and secure, and check-in was easy. We had a list minute check-out request that Gianni graciously allowed. Gianni was quick to respond to texts. The apartment and furnishings were very comfortable. The AC was a plus as temps were in the 90s when we visited. However, the bedrooms did get a little warm if the doors were closed. We did not get a chance to use the rooftop patio. <br/><br/>A minor complaint - TV with standard cable is listed as an amenity but there was no cable service. We had to connect to a laptop and stream if we wanted to watch anything (cables were provided). We felt the cleaning fee was a little steep as the appliances and furniture weren't super clean to begin with - stains on the oven from cooking, some crumbs stuck in the coffee table, and scuffs on the furniture. Again, personally, minor to us. It's clear this is a personal residence and we enjoyed the personal touches. Overall we would definitely stay again."
4475,127448,2019-06-26,Antonio is a very nice and helpful host. If you have any questions he will help you anytime. He responds very fast. I enjoyed my stay at his place. It was perfectly fine for sleeping and as expected. I would recommend it anytime. The house is in a very quiet area so nothing which disturbs your sleep ;)
4476,610657,2019-06-03,"Sam was responsive. The location was convenient because it was close to the subway station, just a short walk. The apartment wasn't as pretty as we had expected, but seemed like a typical NY apartment. The WiFi was down when we were there and the cable company couldn't get there until after we left... But he gave us a partial refund, so that was pretty cool of him. We never met him, but he seemed nice over messaging."
4477,666635,2019-02-19,Great value for the location! Diane is awesome as a host and responds promptly! Would definitely stay here again.
4478,210750,2020-08-13,"This place is so comfortable & exceeded my expectations I really felt at home & at ease, definitely would love to stay here again."
4479,749976,2020-02-01,"Everything was exactly as advertised. Easy self check-in, and Victor was very accommodating of my check-in hours. During my stay, I felt very safe, and I enjoyed this quiet Airbnd, with the expected New York City background sounds. My personal space was also fully respected. There is easy, and immediate access to the bus, and direct connections to the entire metro transportation system. In one direction you'll find a six minute walk to restaurants, stores, banks, and more, and in another direction it's a 15 minute walk.  Great suggestions by Victor on his Airbnd."
4480,418840,2019-12-12,Postazione strategica comoda alla metropolitana in un magnifico quartiere con tutti i servizi. Appartamento ampio ideale per una coppia
4481,9059,2019-11-07,I enjoyed my stay in the house of Lara. You'll find yourself right next to Columbus Circle in Manhatten. A very nice neighborhood to start exploring the city. Lara war friendly and very helpful in delivering the keys and giving me the instructions for the room. Everything was clean and I slept very well in the bed.
4482,565768,2021-11-16,This was an amazing stay in Brooklyn. We were one block away from the 3 line which took us right into Manhattan. <br/><br/>The Airbnb was super clean and beautifully decorated and the communication with the host was superb. We will definitely come stay again!
4483,732771,2019-06-25,"My stay at Chimo was amazing, close to the subway so getting to and from the city by local transport was super easy. When I finally sat with her she was super open and friendly and even allowed me to taste her world famous Joloff rice (a little inside joke) which was amazinggggg. Definitely a super host."
4484,191633,2019-12-09,"Everton's place is the crowned jewel of the Bedstuy neighborhood. It is located in a wonderful, family oriented area that made our travel experience memorable (for all of the right reasons). The condo was impeccably clean and had a detailed host of amenities not found in hotels. I felt as though I was at my own home during my weekend at Everton's place. I would recommend this place to ANYONE looking for a fantastic 3 bedroom 3 bathroom while in Brooklyn"
4485,582245,2021-11-27,"Great location, bang for your buck and has all the amenities for 1-2 people for sure! Eric was amazing for meeting me at the late hour I had to arrive due to plane ticket changes! The residence comes with a key, not a keypad entry. However, everything was pretty great and it was accessible to the Bronx market and the subway 149th St concourse which is ideal to use for commuting around the city! I would suggest bringing and pre-taking allergy meds if you have bad allergies and all like me :) but other than that, this property is WHERE IT IS AT !!!!"
4486,774750,2019-09-09,The host canceled this reservation 4 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

4488,736644,2019-07-19,"Chantal is a super fantastic and responsive host, her place is spotless (most of the furniture and kitchen items are brand new!); there was no air con but that said, we were there during a mega heat wave and the (brand new) ceiling fans were really comfortable, we didn't miss the air con. The neighbourhood is residential, not really close to the metro but well serviced by bus."
4489,405404,2020-01-01,"Great apartment, it is as good as you can see in the pictures, really comfortable and warm. The location was perfect, you can walk to most of the iconic places in Manhattan. It also felt as a safe neighbourhood and there were good pubs nearby."
4490,757404,2021-10-29,Always great staying at Louann place highly recommend her place.
4491,548342,2019-10-27,"Highly recommended! The location is amazing (next to Metro and party street, and surprisingly not loud). Viktoria is great and accommodating (let me leave the luggage in the apt until my evening train), and the place is incredibly clean. You share the toilet with Viktoria, which was no problem. Building has an elevator, which was very handy. The room is small but totally fine for NYC, and she even provides towels. Would love to be back!"
4492,19350,2020-09-17,"I stayed here for a full month. The location is the main selling point, it's a trendy fun part of the city. Apartment has kind of a strange set up with the bedroom next to the street (so expect street noise). The host was friendly and very responsive, and the photos are accurate.<br/><br/>My only issue staying here was a mosquito/bug problem, which may be worse in the summer months.  You walk through a swarm of flies when you enter the apartment. A few mosquitoes would get in every day (through the window screens or front entrance), so I was constantly swatting mosquitoes inside the apartment and got a few bites in my sleep."
4493,713537,2019-09-16,"Nous avons passé une semaine chez Krista avec une amie et notre séjour s’est très bien passé. Krista est à l’écoute et très arrangeante pour l’arrivée et le départ si vous souhaitez qu’elle garde vos bagages. Le logement est dans un quartier sécurisé d’Harlem et à 5 minutes à pieds de deux lignes de métro à environ 20 minutes de Times square. <br/>La propreté est irréprochable dans les chambres et les parties communes. Le matelas est très confortable et elle fournit le nécessaire de toilette!!! <br/>En bref, rapport qualité prix parfait et conforme à l’annonce! <br/>Merci encore pour ce séjour ☺️"
4494,599882,2021-09-26,"Hugo was a wonderful host. Yes, the room is in a shared apartment but the set up is made to feel like your own private home. We were provided keys, a mini-fridge, an A/C unit and awesome recommendations. NYC was a great visit and this place made it even better. Convenient location and great host!"
4495,834966,2021-01-14,"Hector's place was nothing short of amazing and convenient. Expect a kitchen with literally everything you ever need to cook, a clean bathroom, and comfortable nights in your bed watching Netflix on a gigantic TV. The area is also very nice and convenient with various markets, places to eat, and a subway station. Bouldering around the corner if you're into that. Hector is an absolutely amazing host who will make sure you feel welcome and that your needs are satisfied for your entire stay. Can't thank him enough for a wonderful experience!"
4496,452242,2021-04-04,"Greenpoint is absolutely beautiful, a great place to stay and a very comfortable place to stay"
4497,614576,2019-08-28,"L'appartamento di Maurice è accogliente, dotato di ogni comfort, spazioso, pulitissimo e posto in una zona molto tranquilla. Diversi negozi e supermercati sono presenti nelle vicinanze,compresa una lavanderia self-service.<br/>Linee della metro vicine sia per Manhattan che verso Coney Island, autobus sotto casa per le varie zone di Brooklin.<br/>Maurice è stato un host gentile e disponibile, molto solerte nelle risposte.<br/>New York offre molte possibilità di alloggio ma questa è consigliatissima."
4498,516502,2019-07-20,Fantastic location with large rooms. Very convenient to grand central with plenty of places to get groceries or a bite to eat only a short walk away.
4499,722110,2021-01-29,"Lovely home, hardworking mother, lovely well mannered and respectful kids :) .<br/>Just respect her home , shes very helpful and caring."
4500,378664,2019-05-30,"Nous avons passé un excellent séjour chez Leticia, le logement était conforme à la description et nous avons particulièrement apprécié la propreté des lieux et le confort, notamment la literie qui était de très grande qualité (et quand on marche 20 km par jour à New-York c'est un critère essentiel ;) ) <br/>Leticia était très réactive et nous a donné toutes les indications utiles pour nous orienter autour du logement. C'est une hôte très attentionnée, qui a pensé à chaque détail pratique pour ses invités: bouteilles d'eau à disposition, parapluies, chargeurs usb pour les téléphones, pèse bagage, ... <br/>En conclusion je recommande ce lieu à 200% ! merci Leticia!"
4501,284204,2019-09-02,Very nice host. Host also gave local tips when we met. The room we stayed was good and clean.
4502,671382,2021-09-05,"El lugar es tal cual la descripcion, muy acogedor  y limpio, su ubicacion es de lo mejor, llegamos en horas de la noche y parece muy seguro,  buenos sitios para comer y comprar todo lo que necesites, le doy un 10 en relacion calidad precio...muy bueno¡¡¡"
4503,843541,2021-06-06,Looked exactly like the pictures. Great location & value.

4505,93197,2019-02-18,"Rosa's room is so clean and spacious, the bathroom is sparkling clean, as well! The location is excellent, within 5 minutes to everything you need. Rosa is also a super respectful house owner, she gave me so much personal space and I feel really comfortable to stay at her place. I would definitely stay here again for my next trip!"
4506,341392,2020-01-13,Neida's place was AMAZING! Quiet and immediately comfortable. I had no problems settling into the space. Neida herself is a charming host that I instantly warmed up to. Can't wait to visit again!
4507,822209,2021-07-20,"168 Lefferts Pl. was spacious, clean, comfortable and welcoming. Proximity to the subway was a big plus, too.  Our host, George, was very responsive. The modern kitchen is well-equipped with ample china and cookware. A closet and two chests of drawers provide plenty of storage for clothing. A big, comfortable bed and blackout curtains ensure a good night's sleep. The clawfoot tub was a bit of a challenge for seniors like us but there is a rubber safety mat available by the tub. We especially loved the plush towels."
4508,523208,2019-05-30,"Big spacious place, quiet area. Super clean. Great communication with host. If you’re planning on doing most of your activities in Manhattan it is quite far about 10-15 walk to nearest station. And 20-30mins to downtown."
4509,823502,2021-04-05,Wow. Jenny’s place is beautiful. Sparkling clean with all the thoughtful details. Plenty of space to spread out. Quiet. Lots of street parking. Thanks again.
4510,831032,2021-04-12,"I truly enjoyed my stay at Pam’s listing. She was responsive, attentive, hospitable, and accommodating. With regard to the listing itself: there are beautiful French doors that welcome you into the bedroom space. The home has incredible, natural light and a homestyle personality. The listing is close to the subway, several local food spots, a grocery store and a gas station that are no more than a 7 to 12 minute walk depending on where you’re going. For those worried about location—you shouldn’t be. Everyone minds their business in the area. Additionally, the home is safe and secure. There’s a keypad entry system in place and a lock box. Pam has housekeeping that will make themself available, should you need assistance as well. Overall, it’s one of the best bets for a listing in Bedstuy."
4511,858632,2021-07-25,"We spent a week in the Sonder apartment on John Street. Great location, only a couple minutes walking distance to a big subway station. Clean apartment, with a kitchen, a working desk for two people, sofa and round table. Love the walk in closet. Comfy bed. Air conditioning unit worked well for us. Even though it is a busy area, it’s quiet inside the condo (we are on 7th floor). All in all, very good stay and we will stay here again."
4512,864833,2021-08-08,"Subrina was such a sweet, helpful,  and considerate host, I felt very safe with her, and privacy is important for me so I really loved and appreciated that she also placed great importance on this. The room is very cozy and not too warm as there is a fan. Additionally the train station is very close so it makes it easy to go places and it also feels safe to be so close by when you need to travel in the night time. There are also dollar stores and restaurants walking distance so if you ever need something you’ll surely be able to get it. I highly recommend staying with Subrina she is a joy to be around!!"
4513,674052,2019-03-03,Great place better than expected! Definitely will book it again when ever im in nyc !!
4514,356268,2021-07-06,"I had a good stay in this apartment. I didn’t meet Maya in person, but she was very prompt, pleasant and responsive with all her communication. The check-in process was awkward since Maya does not live in this apartment. She had to call someone else to let me in, though they had known about my arrival in advance.<br/>The bedroom I stayed in was not the same as that shown in the listing. It was smaller, which was ok for one person, but may be tight for a couple. I’ve asked the host to update the photo, you should double check if you’re staying in the room shown in the photos or not.<br/>The room had a desk/chair, a set of drawers, and a small in-built closet with hangers. The bed was medium firm, and felt pretty comfortable for me. The position of the room has some advantages, it’s away from the kitchen and living area, so it’s a bit quieter, and it’s not facing a street, or the thrash carts of the building. Instead, it faces another brownstone apartment only thirty feet away, so the level of noise will depend on the neighbors. I didn’t have trouble sleeping soundly on most nights, but the upstairs neighbors sometimes stomp like elephants and drop weights late at night.<br/>There are two other bedrooms in the apartment, with two single, gen Z guys living there. They were welcoming and friendly, and also 420-friendly, but kept their smoking away from the living area.<br/>There is no AC unit in the living area or in the bedroom that I stayed in, so in summer it can get very hot inside. There is a large fan in the bedroom that helps, and I bought an extendable insect screen to keep the window open at night without letting in the mosquitoes, so you should find the insect screen there.<br/>I had access to the shared bathroom, as well as the kitchen to cook and prepare meals, these were easily accessible most of the time. Washer/dryer combo is also in the kitchen area. The shared areas are not as clean as they were according to earlier reviews, so this can be improved.<br/>The apartment is up two flights of stairs, on the third floor of a typical NYC five-story brownstone building, with no elevator. The location suited my needs, it’s half a block from Riverside Dr. and two blocks to the 1 (local) subway train, in a Latino-flavor hood."
4515,420575,2021-05-20,"The place was immaculate and just as described. Andrew and Adriana were fantastic! They were super friendly, available when needed, and had great communication about the place. The apartment is in the perfect location next to multiple lines on the trains and subways. A short ride anywhere into Manhattan, Coney Island, Queens, etc. There is also many great food places nearby to try! Andrew and Adriana provide a booklet with everything you need to know and things to eat or do locally. Overall one of the best Airbnb’s I have had the pleasure of staying in :) I recommend to anyone traveling to NYC"
4516,30797,2019-05-22,"I highly recommend Katherine's studio for being close to major attractions, subway stations and market, it is organized and clean. She responds quickly to the messages, checks if everything is ok with the stay and was very flexible in our checkout."
4517,707397,2019-11-03,"Great location in a charming neighborhood. Easy walk to subway station, bars, coffee, etc. Nice local touches like a Clinton Hill coffee table book with lots of photos of the neighborhood from years past.  Busy street in the day but quiet at night. It's on the NYC Marathon route so we got to see the runners go by before we checked out! Highly recommended!"
4518,545668,2020-02-17,Super cozy! Awesome space and host. Very attentive and responsive. The space is EXACTLY as pictured. Book it!

4521,343897,2019-06-21,"This is a great place to stay! It’s in a fantastic location - close to the subway to go into the city, or all the great stuff in Brooklyn. The place has everything you need, and Deirdre is a great, communicative host."
4522,775237,2019-11-13,"This is a true NYC experience. The host is an angel. Dont take advantage but if she offers to make you a cup of coffee or a meal, don't say no, its likely to be the best you get. The room is small and its the energy of a hostle. Clean bed in a small private space, perfert for someone staying busy with what NYC offers."
4523,876631,2021-07-26,Great location for getting in and out of Manhattan.  Jaime was very responsive for all our needs and the place is a nice size.  Great value for the price!  I'd gladly stay here again.
4524,269693,2019-05-10,"Had some issues with checking in at our time because there was a big group leaving later, and the cleaner still had to come in. As well as the cleanliness itself, having to check in later we were really hoping it would be cleaner. Docked 2 stars for that. 2/3 stars go to Justin for being so incredible! Very friendly, welcoming, and made us all feel comfortable and loved! I highly recommend staying here just for him. Third star is for location, you couldn’t get more central! Overall thank you we still had a great time, there’s things to be improved but would consider staying again!"
4525,819389,2020-07-25,A beautiful place

4531,672275,2020-08-21,Great basement apartment.  Everything you need is in kitchen. Close to shopping.  Very responsive and just a great overall place to stay!
4532,173857,2019-07-22,"Good location in Brooklyn, close to metro stations and with a bus stop in front of the building. The check in was easy and the host was always very fast to answer every communication. The kitchen is very well equiped.<br/><br/>But it is important to mention the problem we had during our stay with the air conditioner. The moment we arrived we noticed that the air conditioner didn't work, and we communicated it to the host. Brian and Arlette were very kind in apologizing and trying to solve the problem immediately, by installing a portable air conditioner in the middle of the night. The next morning, at 6:00 a.m., they had already bought a brand new one device, and installed it the same day. But the problem persisted, even with the new air conditioner, because it didn't have the correct power: it was a 8.000 BTU, once for a room of that size in the hot summer of new york would need at least 14.000 BTU. So, even with all the efforts, the problem persisted. We had to sleep 5 nights in a room where the lower temperature was 82ºF or 28ºC, my wife had to wake up in the middle of the night to take a cold shower and get back to sleep. The host argued that he did everything he could, that in that heat wave no air conditioner would work properly, but i don't believe it is true. It would have worked properly if it had the correct cooling capacity of 14.000 BTU or more. So, if you are going to this place in the summer, make sure they have bought a new air conditioner with the correct BTU power."
4533,879373,2021-11-11,My partner and I had a wonderful stay! Yvette is an extremely kind host and an excellent resource for questions about the city. The apartment is always kept clean. The location is pretty laid back with a solid food scene as well!

Located in Chinatown it is a good starting point for your sightseeing activities. Walking distance to the financial district. Subway close by. I really enjoyed the stay.
4538,158770,2020-09-14,This lovely apartment is nestled in a beautiful area. It’s bright and airy and has everything you need for a comfortable stay. Great for longer stays as the place has a nice kitchen and is close to many restaurants and shops. The apartment and the building are very clean and well kept. Neighborhood is safe and nice for walking. Gillian was a gracious host who answered questions within a few minutes and made sure we had everything we needed. Would highly recommend!
4539,629856,2019-05-20,The apartment is located in a great area close to restaurants and local bars.  It was a short and easy commute to Manhattan.  Vasilisa’s place is very spacious and she was an attentive host.
4540,736402,2019-06-24,"This home is very nice home. What you see in the pictures, is what you get. Qing is very quick with his replies. If you need anything he will try his best to get it. Be careful when walking into the kitchen. There's a step. I hit my foot on it a couple of times, but you get used to it! Other than that, it's clean and very comfortable."
4541,830149,2021-08-24,"Muy bonito hospedaje, amplio y un barrio tranquilo, volvería sin duda"
4542,786526,2019-12-18,The host canceled this reservation 11 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
4543,801711,2021-08-13,"I had an amazing stay at Liz's place. It is a lovely studio apartment with garden access just as pictured. The location can't be beat, lots of stores and restaurants and fun things to explore right out the door.<br/>Liz is a great host, very communicative and helpful.<br/>I would absolutely stay here again and recommend it to anyone visiting the city."
4544,703898,2021-08-01,Great guy! <br/>Came down to the lobby to meet me and help me out with my luggage
4545,401690,2019-12-18,"Alina’s home was wonderful. Also she is an amazing host. The pictures of the home is actually what you get. I really enjoyed the basement setup, because it became my creative space for me to work on my craft while relaxing.All in all this home was worth every penny for the stay and will be returning."
4546,878389,2021-10-21,Wonderful place to stay. Walking distances from many stores and restaurants. Host will reply to you in a timely manner by that I mean quick responses.

4550,848443,2021-07-22,Good location and fair price.
4551,733975,2021-09-15,"Apartment was very clean, close to great restaurants, and had easy access to the L train. From the L train, easy transfers to get anywhere you might want to go in Manhattan. A great deal!<br/><br/>(Only caution I’d give people is that the two flights of stairs to the apartment would be challenging if you struggle with stairs. They’re high and not completely even, a common struggle in old buildings.)"
4552,641871,2021-09-19,2C is an awesome room with own private bathroom. Everything was clean with no issue. Location is great and within walking distance to downtown flushing and the metro.
4553,545722,2019-01-03,"Vigil's apartment is perfect for its price. I stayed at her place for a week around New Year's Eve, as a young tourist traveling alone. The apartment is in Harlem, at equal distance (5-10 min walking) between two subway stops, where several lines are available. The closest bus stop is almost in front of the building. I would say that the neighborhood is very well connected with the rest of the city. The apartment is on the second floor and is quiet, although the street can be noisy from time to time (never enough to wake me up at night). The bathroom is shared, which was never a problem, and the kitchen as well. I used it mainly to consume take-away food, but Vigil had prepared an empty cupboard for me and had made all her cutlery and dishware available. The heating in the whole apartment was perfect.<br/>On top of that, Vigil is a very nice and interesting person. She enjoys chatting with her guests but is also fine if you need your privacy after a long day. In the period I was there, she was often home: I got great advice from her on the city of New York, that she knows very well. I hope she manages to accomplish her goals so that people can soon take advantage of her inspiring ideas and art :)"
4554,214457,2019-12-02,"Living in NYC for a long time before we moved away, we didn't expect much from staying in an apt in Jackson Heights. However, Karen's place turns out much better than we hope. It's very clean and well stocked. It's a few blocks away from the main station at 72nd St where we get to the city in 30 min. The area restaurants are very good and inexpensive. We tried out the food at the Nepal restaurant (Friends Corner) across from the station and it was excellent.<br/>Karen and his father were quick to solve any issue we had during the stay. She put much thoughts into preparing a book with all the info you need. We use the taxi service she recommenced in the guide and it costs only $24 to get to the JFK. Uber would be $40 or more.<br/>Like everything in NYC, houses are older than most so you will encounter quirks like creaky floors, stairs. But it's as real as it gets to living in NYC."
4555,574033,2021-04-27,"Nate's place is a solid 5. The room was well appointed, clean, with a comfortable bed and a private bathroom. Nate was accommodating with our early arrival. He was warm and welcoming before we even set foot on the property. Location was great for exploring Brooklyn, and was a short 5-7 minute walk to the J train into Manhattan. Great experience, great value."
4556,847683,2021-08-06,very good clean place and good location thanks Jake.
4557,816464,2021-05-30,"Gonzo's apartment was a lovely place to stay. I spent six weeks there, largely working from home, and found it met all of my needs. The bed was nice and comfortable, and the wifi was very fast. The location is also unbeatable. I'd recommend it to anyone needing a home base in Williamsburg."

4565,519218,2019-11-17,"This place is an awesome deal, with wonderful people, in a fantastic location. Planning a stay in NYC can be overwhelming, and I feel so lucky that I chose Sahar's!! This is a cozy space in a really cute apartment. If you are a smoker of any sort, there is a private back yard, which is a very rare commodity in New York! I 100% recommend."
4566,485805,2019-03-15,"Great host, lovely place Thank you"
4567,848398,2021-01-09,"Y’all have to book! The place is beautiful and makes you feel as if it’s your home. Comfortable, quiet beautiful place. Paige went above and beyond, and always was on time if I needed anything. Book book."

4578,167645,2019-02-17,"I visited NYC with a friend and we had a very pleasant stay at Fernandos place. It is  just a few walking minutes away from the next subway. The room is not very big, but exactly as in the pictures and it is definitely enough space when you want to explore the city most of the time anyways.<br/>Fernando was very friendly and helpful and could give us some very good tips and advices. We would definitely stay there again."
4579,482084,2021-04-13,Host are amazing. This was a perfect stay. I would definitely recommend booking. Also location was close to all Burroughs and extremely close to transportation.

4584,714542,2020-02-18,"L'appartement de Collen est très bien situé et au calme. Metro à 5 minutes à pieds et 4 stations de union square. Commerces, bars, boutiques, cafés....<br/>Collen était là pour notre arrivée et a été réactif pour répondre à nos demandes."
4585,491568,2019-09-21,"Everything was perfect and Zee is a really great host! Location 10/10, there are restaurants,  grocery stores,  laundry,  banks, everything around the corner and the metro station is at 2-3 minutes walk. We stayed for a week and we really had 0 problems!"

4588,860355,2021-07-28,"Nice tidy location, just as pictured.  Typical NY style. The host was responsive and helpful the transaction was easy.<br/><br/>A few variables to consider, distance from areas of interest.  We did buy transit passes and the train station was about 10 minutes away.  But it took a while to get anywhere.<br/><br/>The amount of noise on the street was fairly bothersome.  Trucks constantly air braking outside the front window and cars racing through at all hours of day/night.  Surprising as this doesn’t appear to be a Main Street.<br/><br/>Mattresses were a bit soft for my liking, but not horrible"
4589,515211,2019-10-08,Logement cher vu le confort très moyen et situé loin des beaux quartiers de Brooklyn.
4590,34282,2019-08-04,Apparemment très bien situé pour visiter près de 3 lignes de métro <br/>Appartement au calme avec la climatisation <br/>Plusieurs magasins alimentaires et laveries automatiques autour de l'appartement

4599,443433,2019-06-16,"Brent’s place is super cute!  He has done an amazing job renovating a classic beach bungalow and has added some really cool features such as skylights and preserving bits of the original structure.  He really has a flair for vintage furniture as well!  <br/><br/>The place is pleasant, quiet, and is conveniently located near groceries, coffee, bars, restaurants, fast food, a bank, the brand new YMCA, the NYC subway, and Rockaway Beach (including the Beach 67th Street surf break).  <br/><br/>Street parking is easy; we parked directly in front of the house every time.  <br/><br/>Brent is great host too!  His communication was fantastic!"

4607,850451,2021-07-12,"The location was amazing with good cafes, grocery, restaurants and subway station within 3min. The building is old, but rooms and bathrooms were maintained very clean. The cleaner forgot to clean our room because we left the luggage before check in time and locked the room, but she came down right away and changed all the beddings in front of us."
4608,668578,2020-03-25,"Excellent place to stay! Would recommend!<br/>Very comfortable and incredibly quiet room with private entrance. Comfortable bed, lots of storage space, TV and high speed wifi. The kitchen is fully equipped and easy to use. Washing facilities in apartment. The bathroom is equipped with everything I needed and even though the kitchen and bathroom are shared with Jon they are incredibly clean and tidy. I rarely saw Jon, though one day we did have a really nice chat when were both in the kitchen. Jon is very polite and kind. Offers great recommendations and is always available if you have any concerns (I did not have any concerns during my stay. everything was perfect).  He is a great host! The place is great! Highly recommend"
4609,574715,2020-08-16,Excellent value. Highly recommend. They sanitized the whole place and made it safe for staying at during this pandemic.
4610,774134,2019-09-15,"Perfect place to stay for a lower/mid budget! It's located 2 blocks away from Subway so there is no place to feel unsafe (south Harlem is still safe), many choices to eat around and a person that will receive you with a big smile trying to make sure everything is exactly as you wanted!"
4611,567696,2019-05-23,"It was a great stay, it’s a nice neighborhood. I would recommend this to friends."
4612,401558,2021-10-02,"Scott is a dream roommate. He's incredibly respectful of the space and your schedule. As we both had different schedules, we barely were in the apartment at the same time but even when we did, it felt like I had the place for myself. He gave me some good recommendations and tips when I asked him of places to eat breakfast nearby or where to do my laundry. He even lent me his detergent for my first time doing laundry! After that, I learned that you can buy a little box of detergent for a buck in the laundromat, which I did but even so he was willing to let me use his. Thank you for everything Scott, again, dream roommate.<br/><br/>Regarding the neighborhood, I think I fell in love with Carroll Gardens. It's quiet and peaceful but at the same time so many places to eat or have a drink. I loved walking up and down Court Street as each time I discovered a new place to try out. If I lived in Brooklyn, I'd definitely would love living in this area. I just left and I'm already looking forward to coming back."
4613,696617,2019-02-18,"Best place to book in my eyes. Close to the train station and 2 blocks from everything you need. The space was clean, cute and exactly what you see in the photos. Will definitely be booking again."

4616,756774,2019-09-17,"Very well situated, near from Manhattan and so quiet: Roosevelt Island is a little paradise in NYC! Donna is a nice person and we appreciated her conversation. Cleo (the cat) is still a little bit shy with the visitors... but we are sure it will get better and better!"
4617,865110,2021-05-30,"Lovely and clean room on a quieter street in Bushwick, and Alex is super sweet and helpful as a host. Definitely recommend to travellers looking for a comfortable space to hang their hat for a few days!"
4618,702600,2019-03-24,We had a wonderful visit in Jackson Heights in March 2019. John was a fantastic host. The apartment was clean and comfortable. Great access in and out. Safe and quiet. We had easy walking distance to Jackson Heights area and subway system. Thanks! We’ll be back.

4624,586814,2019-01-16,Very great apartment!<br/>The location is all right. There are no good shopping possibilities nearby. Not comparable with Williamsburg. The pans and pots in the kitchen were not really clean and the stove did not work properly.<br/>Sharon was very friendly and answered immediately!<br/>Keep it up!
4625,884400,2021-11-02,"Cuando vi el anuncio del alojamiento en Airbnb me pareció dudoso y aun así decidí ponerme en contacto con el anfitrión para descubrir más detalles del espacio. El día que llegué a la ciudad me encontré con una habitación totalmente diferente a las que vi en las fotos, lo cual me hizo sentir muy mal porque se supone que pagué por un espacio para no fumadores y desde que entré al lugar el humo de marihuana invadía todo el espacio lo cual afecta mi salud. De inmediato me puse en contacto con el anfitrión para buscar una solución al problema, pero no fue posible un cambio inmediato de lugar, el anfitrión me indicó que debía actualizar las fotos del anuncio lo cual me pareció totalmente aberrante porque debió notificarme con anticipación que la habitación del anuncio no era la que estaba ofertando. Pasé tres días durmiendo en una cama incomoda, una habitación sin espacio para movilizarme, no tenia dónde poner mi ropa dentro de la habitación porque no había closet y un baño donde no había papel higiénico. Esta fue mi primera mala experiencia con un anfitrión de Airbnb y tuve que buscar orientación con mis amigos  los cuales me recomendaron contactar el portal de servicio al cliente de Airbnb los cuales me ayudaron a solucionar la situación y luego de tres días de mi reserva pude obtener un cambio de habitación con más espacio y cama aceptable. Le recomiendo al anfitrión actualizar las fotos del anuncio, ser atento con los servicios que ofrece en el lugar y lo más importante de todo  es estar atento a las preguntas para responder de manera rápida cuando un huésped requiera de su ayuda. En general no recomendaría el espacio por la mala experiencia que tuve que pasar durante esos días hay buena ubicación pero un espacio malo daña una experiencia en una hermosa ciudad como lo es Nueva York."
4626,611234,2019-05-26,"Aleksandra is an awesome host. She gives us enough privacy, but very helpful when we need help. I really enjoy the night when we sat on the coach drinking wine while chatting about everything. She gave some great recommendations of places to visit. The apartment is very tidy and clean. I had a very relaxing time staying there."
4627,602670,2019-06-30,"Very clean, they responded quickly and were very respectful and attentive. I would stay with them again if I go back for another show."
4628,214461,2020-02-16,"I stayed here with my fiancé, my sister and her boyfriend. We had an amazing stay. Karen & Fabian’s place was more than I could ever ask for. We all felt like we were home. All the little touches to the place made it feel cozy and comfortable. Fully stocked kitchen which made cooking dinner very easy, blankets, towels, and everything you could need plus it was all labeled so it was easy to find everything. Fabian checked in to make sure everything was going well which was so nice. The manual was extremely helpful. It gives you tips on places to eat, places to visit. The area was close to stores and restaurants making it very convenient for us. We all enjoyed staying here and definitely plan on booking this place again in the future. Thank you Karen and Fabian."
4629,482069,2019-07-31,"Seana's place is in a great area. It's only a 5 mins walk to the nearest Metro, Yankee Stadium and even Target.

4640,885772,2021-10-31,"The room was not as clean as advertised, stains on the curtains , all the hangers were tangled,broken, and on the floor. The bathroom was not cleaned properly at all. The shower curtain was too short so it was a hassle everytime one got in the shower. The shower knob constantly came off. The wifi did not work and the tv wasn’t even plugged in or connected to the wifi so we could not even enjoy the amenities included with our stay."
4641,780794,2019-10-24,Good place.
4642,881400,2021-10-04,"I can't say enough how much we enjoyed our stay at UNTITLED. The location was amazing and even though it was small, the room was thoughtfully designed. The built-in storage and furniture was clever and well made. I had no trouble storing my belongings. I look forward to seeing the lobby when the renovations are complete!"
4643,731094,2019-10-01,Very highly recommended!! We loved our stay at the apartment. Adrien was fast to responded and kept checking in to see if all was ok. The location was ideal and quiet and short stroll to the hub of bedford ave. The convenience store next door was handy. Lots of light and having a laundry was great as was the well equipped kitchen. Amazing bed and shower was powerful!!  Everything was perfect. Thanks so much and recommending it to friends.

4648,289441,2021-11-20,"Edward made sure to give very clear and thorough instructions to make the checking in process easy and hassle free. The room is as described. The shower is not in the guest room, but Edward did provide robes. The entire apartment was spotless and nicely appointed. It was a great to start our New York trip."
4649,124231,2019-06-08,"The house is sparkling clean. Caroline is very  warm, courteous  and hospitable. She is  very specific about the house rules. Overall she is very organized and runs an efficient business and responds promptly to questions or concerns."

4651,868278,2021-10-27,"Квартира находиться на Манхеттене. Очень близко от метро. Рядом есть очень классный корейский магазин, там можно купить готовую еду и кучу интересных продуктов. Рядом университет Коламбия, там можно погулять, очень симпатичное место. Также в 2-х кварталах находиться Центральный парк, хоть и не самая ухоженная его часть. Вокруг достаточно закусочных.<br/> Прожили 5 дней, съехали раньше, как только смогли. По прибытию- хосты не могли минут 10-15 внятно нам объяснить в сообщениях,  где находится  наша комната. В комнате нет ничего кроме кровати, неуютно. В общей кухне тоже нет места где можно присесть и отдохнуть. Окно практически вплотную выходит на стену соседнего здания. Замков тоже нет нигде: ни в комнате, ни на двери в общий коридор. Обосновывают пожарной безопасностью. Мы просто закрывали чемоданы на замки и уходили, ценные вещи не оставляли. При заезде было очень грязно, пол был липким и к нему прилипала подошва обуви. Также слой липкой пыли под кроватью. На 3 день мы нашли часть сережки в нашей постели, остальную часть мы нашли под кроватью днем ранее. Это говорит о том, что кровать даже не перестилали перед нашим заездом. В квартире не работал холодильник, работала только морозилка на 20%  состоявшая из наледи и плесени. В общей кухне на 3 комнаты было 3 тарелки- 2 плоские и 1 глубокая, а также 3 стакана, но все стаканы были только в наш первый и последний день прибытия. В своей комнате мы убили 4 таракана - 1 сварился в чайнике. Из 4 ночей мы не спали 2: в одну ночь была шумная вечеринка на этаже до утра, (не в наших апартаментах), а 2-ю ночь капли дождя очень громко падали на блок кондиционера. <br/>При нас не убирались, была коробка из под сухого завтрака, оставленная кем-то, она так и оставалась там лежать все время нашего пребывания. В ванной был забит слив черными волосами, из корзины вываливалась бумага. Но были шампунь и гель для душа. <br/>За вами всегда наблюдает камера в общей зоне. <br/>Также из плюсов - отопление в комнате и приятное в виде фена сверху в ванне. Очень быстрый wi-fi.<br/>Все имеющиеся минусы хосты легко могли бы исправить. Минусы касаются чистоты, удобства заезда, избавления от плесени и насекомых, повесить крючки для полотенец и одежды, поставить несколько стульев или кресел, общий небольшой стол, убирать квартиру, перестилать бельё - но хосты это не делают.<br/>За данные минусы мы попросил возмещение стоимости 50%<br/>Airbnb удовлетворило нашу просьбу."
4652,885828,2021-09-29,"Excelente anfitriona, respondía los mensajes muy rápido y siempre estaba atenta a solucionar o ayudar cualquier cosa. muy buena limpieza y nos sirvió mucho para el viaje que nos dejara a disposición implementos básicos de aseo, de comida e inclusive bebidas."
4653,3936,2019-12-28,"Christmas in New York was somehow better knowing we had such a great place to come back to at the end of the nights. Getting into Manhattan is a breeze, the only struggle can be getting back if you're out in Manhattan after midnight.<br/><br/>The place was so clean, warm and inviting. Jeanne was so easy to talk to if you needed her for anything. <br/><br/>If you get a chance to stay here on a trip to NYC, do not pass it up! It's a beautiful space with plenty to do in the Greenpoint area.<br/><br/>P.S. All the artwork of cats was an incredible touch."
4654,794272,2020-02-28,"I loved staying here! The neighborhood and street are darling -- tons of beautifully maintained brownstones and I was able to walk to nearby coffee shops each morning. <br/><br/>They allowed me to check in a few hours early, which was really kind, and the home was delightful. Heater worked well in winter, it had an easy-to-use fireplace, and some very soft towels. I really enjoyed my stay here!"
4655,571328,2019-05-31,"Jerry is the perfect host. His lovely apartment is in a great location, quiet, clean - and Jerry communicates quickly and fully! Highly recommend."
4656,495510,2019-09-27,Room nice and clean and for good price. There is no subway unfortunately and place is close to airport so you can hear planes around.
4657,442963,2019-11-02,"Sonia and Bryan are absolutely lovely and always answered very quickly my messages! the studio is exactly as advertise, however as a young woman I didn't feel really safe walking in the area alone in the evening. I would also recommend getting ear plugs as it can get a bit noisy during the evening/night. Overall I had a really nice stay, fast internet, the bed is confortable, supermarket and underground really close to the studio as well."
4658,760301,2019-11-10,Nice
4659,361615,2019-11-26,"Centrally located and surprisingly quiet. This space is cosy, clean and comfortable with lots of shopping, restaurants and access to several subway lines nearby.

4663,737477,2021-03-31,"I really enjoyed my stay with Nick at his place in the East Village.  It's on a quiet street, and you're a few short blocks to Tompkins Square Park and the bustling part of the EV.  It quickly became my favorite area of NYC.  In addition, Nick is very accommodating, friendly, and transparent.  Would stay again."
4664,649000,2019-06-02,"Just a few minutes from the J train, very easy to get to Manhattan and close to other Bushwick night spots! Dr. Jihene is such a pleasure to know! I am a better person for having met her!"

4667,790047,2020-07-29,I had a good time during my stay. The host was very welcoming and friendly. I would definitely come back again in the future.
4668,577855,2021-10-01,"We had a great 4-night stay at Zeleke's place & appreciate how clean he keeps it! It's a long narrow below-sidewalk space with a beautiful wood floor & a lot of overhead lights. No view, but quite comfortable with a front & back window, plus a little outdoor area out back with a small Weber BBQ (use foil to grill). The small living room loveseat & chair are fine, & the little triangular kitchen is workable. A tiny lit fountain in the bedroom is a lovely touch. The bed is an older double that's comfortable enough, though a queen would fit, & there are 2 window A/Cs at either end of the place (circulated cool air in late Sept.) The apt. is very quiet despite occasional walkers out front, & beautiful Morningside Park is only a block west. One boulevard to the east offers some nice restaurants, & the subway station is only 4 short blocks north. It's easy to walk to more hoppin' parts of Harlem from the apt., or the other way to Columbia U., & it provides an excellent base for getting to other parts of town, especially with the express trains that take you to Columbus Circle in about 10 mins, Times Square in about 15, & Greenwich Village in around 20. Zeleke is a charming & kind guy; he lives upstairs & is happy to help with anything. This is a perfect lower-priced space for a single person or a couple who wanna trip the light fantastic around NYC!"
4669,646914,2019-12-05,A great place: take it

4675,732798,2021-03-06,"Walls are thin , however It was a wonderful stay . Felt like staying over a cousins house . I don’t believe cooking is allowed but there was a kitchen available for cleaning dishes and light meals can made in the microwave. Cozy room and clean bathroom."
4676,784045,2021-05-31,Very nice clean.  Very close to all I needed.  Low ceiling so if you all tall (over 6’4”) be careful. Otherwise great place. Will stay again
4677,733383,2019-06-23,"I totally recomended this accommodation. Everything was perfect. The loft is beautiful, very well located and geraldine made sure we had everything we needed. Even coffee and tea available. The house has all (!!) you could need to take the best of your stay in new york. Also, the neighborhood is top, from beautiful to clean, and with all the services at a walking distance (supermarket, coffee shops, bakeries, restaurants, bars, parks, ...). Also, you will literall (Website hidden by Airbnb) minute walk from the subway. We couldn’t ask for more!!"
4678,695722,2019-02-18,Amazing place and amazing people. Me and my boyfriend had the best time there. The area is really authentic and in a few minutes you are in Manhattan. John was the best host we could have because we helped us and he also cooked for us. We felt like we are at home and this is something unique. The apartment was really clean and we had a awesome time!
4679,346497,2021-09-11,Would stay again.
4680,723726,2019-06-19,"First and foremost my stay was 5 star without a doubt, nothing I am saying in this review is any way a critique or negative - just things to consider when looking at this listing. Lets start with the space itself; the room is perfect for one or two, the bed is a soft memory foam mattress - so it sleeps hot and may not work for those in need of more support (especially with all the walking you will do in this city). There is a cooling unit which works great, just close the door and let it run for about ten minutes and the room will be nice and cool and stays that way for quite a while. The bathroom is small and basic, good for one person at a time. The sink seems to leak a little around the base of the faucet for both temps. Shower works great and will get very hot. The cat is very kind and tends to itself and didn't once come back to where the room is. As someone who has slight cat allergies I was cautious about dander but Anderson does a great job of keeping the ENTIRE place clean and free of dander and I had no problem with my allergies. The breakfast prepared EVERY MORNING, is promptly delivered to the door around 8am; so if you do not desire a wholesome breakfast, that will definitely tie you over until lunch, you may want to communicate that ahead of time.  Anderson's place is located in East Flatbush which is not a gentrified area of Brooklyn; that was perfect for me but may not work for others. For those who are using the public transit system, which is a fantastic way to save money while visiting NYC, this place is next to a few major bus routes, and within a few miles of some subway stations as well. I visited each borough during my stay with ZERO issues getting around. The corner store was super inexpensive, I recommend it but use cash in there. Also within a couple of blocks are great amenities, for laundry I used the place Anderson recommended (6 Star Laundromat & Dry Cleaners). If you're in need of a barber I recommend Webb's Barbers, one of the best haircuts I've ever had ( I am a Marine Veteran so i know something about haircuts) and at $12 that price is hard to beat vs other major cities. For eats within a couple of blocks I would try Kennedy Fried Chicken (a local staple chain), Joyce's (Jamaican cuisine), and Eats Delicious Bakery and Restaurant. Anderson as a host went above and beyond any expectation I could have of an AirBnB host. She is truly someone who enjoys hosting and takes great pride in being helpful, kind, and accommodating. If this is your first time staying with a host she is going to set the bar very high. Overall I would recommend this listening to people whom I know, and I hope anyone who stays here after me has a similar positive experience (Website hidden by Airbnb) My stay: 12-19 June 2019"
4681,466665,2019-11-12,"I and my boyfriend stayed with Chelsea for 4 days and had a great experience! The room, bathroom and kitchen was very clean which was important to us. The location is great, very safe, and super close to the subway and walking distance to all local attractions (including lots of cozy coffee shops) in Brooklyn. <br/><br/>I would definitely recommend this place!"
4682,709083,2021-05-10,Super close to Little Italy and a great host.
4683,16016,2019-09-26,"Mich’s place was just right—comfortable, cozy, close to good food and great spots, easy access to the subway, steps away from Tompkins Sq. Park. Mich was super communicative, laid-back, and helpful. Check-in was super easy and check out was a breeze."
4684,887930,2021-11-12,Very good
4685,653438,2019-09-12,Gail's place serves the purpose if you are visiting/working anywhere near St. John's University. Lots of options to eat nearby. Description of the place is accurate. Thanks Gail for hosting us.
4686,733290,2019-12-16,Place was super clean and convenient to the train. Quick ride to the city and a lot of restaurants near by as well. The process was super easy as well.
4687,25142,2019-06-28,"We really enjoyed staying at Roberta's place! Roberta was always quick to respond when we emailed, called or messaged her, and was always helpful. The apartment is clean, comfortable and attractive, and we found we had everything we needed.  The subway and buses are convenient, and there were some nice restaurants in the neighborhood, as well as a great bakery and cheese shop. The apartment was a quiet, restful place to return to after busy days in Brooklyn and Manhattan. I highly recommend!"

Plenty of places to eat and close to the train. Full kitchen and kitchen supplies. Be sure to bring all your own soap, shampoo, and a sponge and dish soap if you’re planning on washing dishes."

There is a Whole Foods and CVS right around the corner which I found very convenient. The apartment is clean and had all the amenities you would need. The apartment is a little small, but that’s what to expect in a New York studio. Overall the location was perfect and made for a wonderful stay."

4702,653101,2021-03-21,"A good place to stay, prav is a good host"
4703,884242,2021-11-07,Convenient neighborhood and clean studio. But the stairway of two steep flights you walk up is very old and smelly. The noise from the bar below spills out onto the street into the early morning hours so after my first night I chose to stay on my daughters couch. Way too pricey for this kind of place.
4704,740287,2020-04-16,Willie is in-fact a very friendly and attentive host. Keep in mind this is not a private studio and/or apartment it is a basement with VERY loud people who live upstairs. I’m from NY and the noise was too unbearable but overall the place itself was nice.
4705,311573,2021-07-20,"I had an extended stay at the house of balance which was very lovely. Maria and Kosta were so accommodating and a pleasure to coordinate with. They really made me feel comfortable and were very responsive throughout my entire stay. <br/><br/>The apt is located in a great part of Astoria, a short walking distance from anything you may like grocery, midnight snacks, and restaurants. I had a car with me and never really struggled to find parking nearby. The apartment is also close to the N/W subway line as well as multiple bus routes— prime location. <br/><br/>Thank you again for your hospitality and for hosting me."
4706,422002,2019-05-27,A very nice place with all  amenities provided for. A great host who was more the cooperative with our requests for flexible check-in and check-out timing. Would recommend his place for all!

4711,798382,2021-09-01,"The apartment was a nice size, very clean, and remarkably quiet for being in an urban setting.  We stayed there since we were going to the US Open.  We generally used Uber to go to / from the US Open even though the subway was a 10/15 minute walk from the apartment. If you are from ""suburbia"", there are not a lot of food options immediately surrounding the apartment that a suburban palate would be used to; however, there is a Dunkin Donuts just a minute's walk from the apartment, a couple fast food options near the subway, and an Italian restaurant that offers delivery."
4712,622768,2019-06-12,"Very convenient for the Yankee game I supposed go to, stores nearby, and parking wasn’t TOO much of a pain. Telia has a very nice space and I’m happy I stayed here"

4714,569097,2019-12-31,"We had a lovely stay in this pretty, bright, & cozy home.  There was just the right amount of space for the five of us, and we had everything we needed.  The beds were comfy.  The location was wonderful.  Brooklyn was so peaceful while Manhattan was so incredibly packed.  There were parks, playgrounds, and great restaurants nearby, and Manhattan was an easy subway ride away on the F train.  On the days we visited Manhattan, we looked forward to coming back to Brooklyn each night.  Holly was kind and helpful, and she always responded quickly when I needed to reach her for something.  I definitely recommend this sweet space."
4715,835989,2021-08-02,The studio was clean and spacious. Truly enjoyed my stay! Katherine was very flexible and was a pleasure to work with.
4716,887226,2021-10-11,"This was the perfect place to stay for me and my friend! Conveniently-located in a fun and walkable neighborhood, close to a subway station. The room was very clean; On the smaller side but we knew that from the photos, and perfectly fine for us as we spent little time in the room.

4721,611270,2020-09-23,"A fantastic stay! Me and my boyfriend enjoyed the area and the home. Only thing I would make a note of is there is a daycare next door, so the children do go in the backyard to play which is so cute but if you are a bit of a noise sensitive person then there’s that. But otherwise, Aleksandra was a great host and everything was very homey there were no complaints!"
4722,764248,2019-12-14,Great Appartement in a great Location. We felt very comfortable and enjoyed our stay.

4729,874988,2021-10-15,"It was a last minute booking in the late evening. The front porch was dark. The porch light was loose and flashing. instructions on how to check in was not clear. I called to ask for clarification and the hostess responded, ""Did you not read my email?"" in a bad tone. I did not let it bother me too much, but then there was urine left in the toilet. The did not look like it was cleaned for a while. On top of that the bed linen and sheets reeked of body odor. I was only able to sleep about 4hrs in that bed. The listing indicates air conditioning in the unit. However, the thermostat was locked at 74 degrees, and I was not able to adjust it. Overall, not a horrible place but I did not feel as comfortable as I had in the past with some other Airbnb rentals."

The place was sparkling clean and had all the necessities you could ask for to stay somewhere for a month. Location was great access and close proximity to everything - Central Park, groceries and cafes, restaurants (socially distanced eateries :-)).<br/><br/>Will recommend Matteo as a host anytime.  Thank you!<br/><br/>Oh, and I got to have a wonderful conversation about our travels when I first met him in person :-).  Cheers!"

Great location, super clean, friendly hosts, felt safe, impressively quiet (only heard honking and sirens- as expected). Perfect for 3 ladies checking out the city for a weekend. (Can confirm there were NO rats/mice, as suggested by the previous guest. They must have imagined that.)"
4737,709515,2019-03-07,Stayed for 10 days and was welcomed. Felt like home and was able to focus on the things that mattered. Comfortable spaces and very hearth like. I would stay here again in an instant and will in future itineraries.

4742,668070,2019-11-11,"I had a great stay at Tim's place. His place was clean, warm, conveniently close to places to eat and the subway, and easy to access.  You can hear the subway from the bedroom, which was fine with me, but your mileage my vary if you sleep light. I recommend Tim's place and wouldn't hesitate to stay there again."

4751,555637,2021-05-31,"Great location within walking distance of Little Italy and Brooklyn Bridge, along with lots of other landmarks. It was fairly clean and Mary is a great host. She communicated very well and made sure we were comfortable and had gotten in just fine even though it was  a late night check in. The entrance to the building has rats - but what place in Manhattan doesn't? Great place for the value and definitely would stay there again."
4752,771311,2019-10-23,"Super warm and friendly host. Anne was truly amazing and accommodating! Even was able to let me drop off my bags early. The location is great if you love central park. I went everyday on my trip! Super quiet, but only a ten min walk to get to the hustle and bustle. So many great places to eat!"
4753,613259,2021-07-26,"Cute little place and very close to beaches and shopping. It's a little off the beaten path and tucked away next to the drawbridge to Long Beach.  But its kinda fun and funky.<br/>You can ride your bike most anywhere which is nice as parking can be tight at times.<br/>The house is clean, the AC is cold, the Wi-Fi fine and the kitchen is well appointed.<br/>Neighbors were nice including the guy next door (who is the block captain) and full of tips and tricks.<br/>There are a few rough edges but nothing huge. All in all we had a great time."

4756,715802,2019-11-04,"El departamento es como se ve en las fotos, recien remodelado, muy bien equipado, hermosa vajilla y elementos de cocina. Las puertas de las habitaciones y la puerta principal dan a un pasillo en el que esta la escalera  por la que se entra desde la calle y al dpto que esta abajo, al principio me genero inseguridad pero la verdad que no tuvimos ningun problema y ademas todas las puertas pueden cerrarse com llave. La parte del comedor es chica pero nosotros eramos 6 y nos acomodamos bien, habian 4 sillas y Dayne amablemente nos consiguio 2 mas. Las camas muy comodas. El subte a dos cuadras, pasa cada 6 minutos y esta a 2 estaciones de Manhattan. Es una muy buena opción!"

4758,844286,2021-05-19,Vals place was clean and comfy. It’s within walking distance of Times Square and Central Park. After a long day of sightseeing it’s the perfect little place to come back to and relax. The hookah bar in front of it is a little loud at times but nothing that really disturbed us. It was easy to access and  safe to stay.
4759,611178,2019-07-24,"Paolo (and Lily) were great hosts and their location was second to none!  I love their neighborhood and don't think I've ever seen a bedroom in Nyc as big as this. They were both  really nice, available for questions, and (bonus) provided an umbrella in my bedroom available for use which really came in handy when we got some storms. Thanks guys! I'll definitely stay here again when I come back to the city."
4760,573141,2020-03-18,"Lugar súper cómodo para cuatro personas o más. Muy completo en su totalidad, con todo lo necesario para pasar la estadía. Michael me ayudó cuando lo necesité. Definitivamente volvería a su airbnb, nos gustó mucho."

4764,646515,2019-08-09,"We were not able to sleep well during our stay due to the firm/hard bed and the police sirens throughout the night. Also, the side door did not lock from the outside on one of the days we stayed, but we immediately notified Liqin and it was fixed. Other than that, the place was super clean and close to Flushing’s Main Street."

Partial view of the buildings in times square from the front bedroom window, which was lovely to look at during the night. Wifi worked out well for Zoom calls. Located near tons of yummy restaurants and fun NYC bars! Subway station was 10 minute walk away and it was easy to explore the whole city."

4777,866536,2021-06-13,"Hotel was what was expected given cost. FYI this hotel doesn't do luggage drop off anymore due to COVID. It doesn't say this on the AirBnB listing or on the hotel's website. When we called the hotel, they told us they had it available. When we checked in, they had a sign that they weren't doing luggage drop off anymore. Half of the reason we picked this place was due to its affordability and luggage drop off. We unfortunately had to pay extra to extend our stay and keep our luggage in our room instead. We were pretty bummed that we had to dish out even more money. Hopefully this review prevents others from dealing with this issue as well."
4778,777932,2021-01-02,"Very Clean, Stylish with space and had amenities there if u forgot something. Great space and definitely would recommend to anyone who wants to stay here. Only one TV in the living room though but otherwise 5 stars  from me!"

4780,790310,2020-03-02,"This was my first time staying in Bay Ridge, so I didn’t really know what to expect. I was pleasantly surprised! The location is stellar— especially if you’re staying for travel purposes to Staten Island. Super close to the subway, bus stops, and a lot of local restaurants. An extremely safe neighborhood and an adorable family. They were always making sure I was taken care of.  I felt very safe being out at night time. The apartment was sparkling clean, along with the bathroom (and it was a nice apartment on top of it being sparkling clean). I will absolutely be staying here again, and definitely recommending it to my friends if they ever need a place in Brooklyn. Amazing for the price!!"
4781,617817,2019-10-02,"We had a wonderful stay at Karine's apartment. The place is really lovely, very well decorated and with everything we needed for our vacations. The pictures doesn't even began to describe how nice the apartment is. Every appliance seems brand new and the overall place is very well taken care of. The location is good, with cafes, convenience stores and restaurants just around the corner, and you have to subway stations really near, it's really well connected. The attentions we received from Karine were really good, she made the arrival and the departure really easy for us. I really recommend this place if you are visiting NY. You can really explore Brooklyn very easily and you are a 20minutes commute for Manhattan, which is great."
4782,788190,2019-11-23,"This apartment was better than I expected. It’s modern and stylist, very clean and well equipped. We had everything we needed. Teresa is such a great host. She was quick to respond and her instructions were very clear. Check in was smooth. The apartment is in such a great location. Restaurants, bars, supermarkets and public transportation are a block or two away. <br/>For sure next time in NYC, without doubt, we will take again in this amazing place! More than a great host and place in NYC."

Everything sparkling clean. The kitchen is next to the room and is well equipped. Just three blocks away there is a KEY FOODS grocery store where I bought some groceries. Jakob not only picked me up at JFK but also dropped me on my departure day at 6 AM !! I appreciate this service which was sooo convenient. I highly recommend this place.
4785,622744,2020-03-11,"Maya is a very sweet host and was easy to keep in contact with if I ever needed anything during my stay. The place is very comfortable and warm, as I was there during a time when it could be a bit colder some of the days/nights and the warmth made it comfortable. During my stay I mainly only took the subway. The walk to the subway was fairly short and the subway had many trains come through so it made it easy to get to any of my planned destinations! There were a few nights when I came back later into the night and I felt pretty safe to walk in this neighborhood. Overall it was a very pleasant stay!!"
4786,283856,2021-08-14,"I had a great stay at Trevor's apartment. Well communicated by train station to cross in less than 20 min to Manhattan, Ferry connections  a few minutes walk near the apartment, bus station nearby to move around  Brooklyn, and also by foot or bicycle.

Edgar is a gem and very responsive. He met us at the apartment and walked us through it. The neighborhood is safe and very walkable. Lots of restaurants and close to Central Park. We also enjoyed walking the East River and the ferry stop is just a mile away. The apartment is stocked with coffee, milk, sugar, all bathroom needs from shampoo to q-tips and a fully loaded kitchen. What makes it extra special is the beautiful artwork covering all the walls. All the special touches make this a find."

The amenities in these units, such as 2 mounted TV’s (in both the living room and bedroom), the full kitchen with dishwasher and a 24/7 laundry room right down the hall make them a great option for people looking for longer stays or month to month apartment rentals. An overall excellent host."

And we had an amazing time :)<br/><br/>The appartment is absolutely gorgeous and really comfortable. The kitchen has all you need and more, the living room is inviting you to have a chill movie night to rest from the busy city and the beds are extremly comfy. <br/><br/>The appartment is also located in a gorgeous, worth to look around neighborhood. Even it might seem a bit far from Manhattan, you are only an hour away from the great spotlights by subway.<br/><br/>SO, the perfect place to be if you plan to stay in NYC  <3"

Nate’s apartment is very comfortable (in hot July weather, we really appreciated the efficient air conditioning!), stylish (we loved Nate’s art!) and a wonderful base for exploring New York. There are nice cafés and convenient shops in the neighbourhood, and both the subway and a lovely park are just a few minutes’ walk away. Nate was out of town while we were there (we only met him on the day we left), but he was really quick to answer messages and super welcoming and helpful throughout our stay. We would love to stay at Nate’s place again!"
4800,653633,2019-12-05,Our stay with Wendy was wonderful! Her apartment was clean and decorated very stylishly. It had everything we needed and was very comfortable. I slept great on her pull out couch. It was perfect for coming back after a long day of roaming around the city to relax. Her place was steps from 2 subway stations which made getting to and from different parts of the city very easy. There is a Dunkin’ Donuts coffee shop about a 5 minute walk away that I walked to every morning. This was a HUGE perk for me! Also a little corner store about 4 doors down from her place. <br/>Wendy is so warm and welcoming and genuinely wants you to get all you can from your visit to NY. She readily offers suggestions and tips and is very easy to communicate with. She genuinely cares about the people she hosts. My friend and I plan to stay with her again when we come to visit NYC next year! Thank you so much Wendy!!
4801,220981,2019-06-03,It was a wonderful stay in the apartment of Robin. She was a welcoming host and we had memorable conversations. Robin kept all of her promises. Next time in NYC i would choose the apartment again and therefore highly recommend it to anyone staying in NYC.

4803,701571,2021-03-14,"My wife and I flew in from Arizona for a wedding. Cherry had welcomed us with this cozy, clean, perfect sized room. It’s conveniently located next to a top rated bagel shop, Bagel Oasis. That was our walking distance bagel shop. Cherry had left us water bottles, a heater if we get cold, towels, and a hair dryer. Coming from Arizona, we knew our clothes would get wrinkled during the flight, Cherry let us borrow her handheld steamer. It was very nice of her. If I was to come back to Flushing/ Fresh Meadows New York I will book this room again. Thank you Cherry!"
4804,760002,2021-08-11,"The place was clean and was just like in the pictures I had no issues and it’s a perfect place if you’re visiting friends and family and need a place to sleep at night, not the best area but I didn’t experience anything crazy while I was there.

4806,768880,2019-09-15,"The area is pretty nice, it has lots of food options and is relatively close to the train. Upon arriving we messaged Feon and he got back to us quick! He greeted us at the door and showed us the ins and out of the place. Our room was very clean and cute, he provided towels and some complementary items and a very useful map of the subway. We shared a bathroom with the guest next to us however it felt like we had it to ourselves the whole time we were there. Feon was an incredible host, he was very helpful when we got lost on the train and  is extremely kind. If we ever come back to New York we won’t hesitate on coming back here!"

I forgot my blow dryer at home and before i went to purchase one i thought to ask Dana if she had one i could borrow. She was very quick to respond and let me know there was one in the bathroom cupboard and if there wasn't i could borrow hers. The area is very nice and the train is easily accessible. I will definitely consider staying here again!"
4809,848389,2021-11-07,"My daughter and I stayed a weekend and the host was amazing. She was responsive to all my questions, the apartment looked exactly like the pictures and was clean. I’m planning to stay again in December. By far the best host I’ve experienced on Airbnb. 10/10"

4816,697085,2020-03-15,"Did not expect to take over an hour to settle into my room, nor fighting between the host and one other person living there. Kitchen and common areas were not clean or tidy, curtains were stained and made of paper (not real curtains!). I’m not sure what the intention was, but alongside the lack of cleanliness and the domestic dispute, I will not be staying here again!"

The accommodation is located next to public transport and supermarket, a café and some spots to get something to eat are just around the corner.

4824,296352,2019-03-24,"Christine's room is a little jewel in the Upper East Side. The private entrance and bathroom make the place very discrete and completely independent. The room and bathroom were very clean and functional. Many little touches, from the hairdryer to the straightener and international power adaptor. Christine was also very communicative and welcoming.<br/>Pros: clean, comfy, discrete and free coffee in the entrance.<br/>Downs: little far from metro stations (10 minutes walk) and on the 4th floor with no elevator."

4827,469332,2021-10-13,Maybe my favorite place to stay in the city. I’m hesitant to say how good this place is & let the secret out! <br/><br/>Do yourself a favor and make sure you have dinner at the restaurant below.  <br/><br/>Already looking to when I can come back!
4828,825585,2021-11-13,"Great stay, Rosemarie was a good host."
4829,696480,2019-07-30,Anna’s place is in a great location and close to some many things. Her place is cute and quaint! Parking is a little hard so it was helpful that she provided Uber and Lyft codes. Great host!
4830,859161,2021-08-12,Great place to crash!
4831,793822,2021-11-20,"Cute place. It's clean, safe and checking in and out was a breeze. Jake is really easy to communicate with. It's in a good location in terms of easily being able to get to the Brooklyn Bridge and walk to the Lower East Side. Oliver Coffee is *delish* - really excellent coffee. Oh and the bed was comfy.<br/><br/>One note, only really if you're a crazy light sleeper like I am (if not, you can ignore this): this building has an older heating system and so the pipes make a clanking sound in the middle of the night. It can also get quite hot (but you can open a window, but then, it lets in more noise). Again - if you're not a light sleeper, not an issue at all, but I feel like I have to mention it for those of us out there who wake up at the tiniest sound!<br/><br/>Definitely a solid choice for visiting New York. Thanks, Jake!"
4832,675482,2021-08-13,"We loved the eclectic decor, the Beastie Boy designed wallpaper in the Reading Room, the awesome hangout kitchen, the very nicely redone master bathroom, the back deck, and the quick access to the subway to transport us on our daily adventures. Our week flew past, but the memories made will definitely linger. Thanks for letting us use your place as our base!"
4833,835180,2021-02-13,Alinca’s place was mad nice :)
4834,864873,2021-11-01,The Airbnb was nice and centrally located. It’s a first floor unit so a bit dark but if you’re coming to nyc to visit it’s unlikely you’ll spend much time in the apartment anyway! Yagmur was very friendly.
4835,524886,2021-05-16,parking
4836,714446,2019-05-01,"Austin's place is located very close to the subway (L-line) which is really convenient. It is also located in a lively neighbourhood, you can find delicious Mexican food close by!<br/>The check-in process was very easy. <br/>The place is indeed very small. There is not much privacy if you're traveling as a couple especially when it comes to using the bathroom.  The bathroom and shower do not have lights. <br/>Be aware that the place is located above a bar so the place is very noisy at night. <br/>It's an okey room if you want something affordable and are not bothered by noise when sleeping."
4837,517216,2019-05-19,Onyx the cat is a star and a gem!
4838,808579,2021-03-14,"If you need anywhere to crash for a night and you don’t care much about the space, this is for you.<br/><br/>The bathroom door is a folding closet door with no handles that doesn’t close properly unless you slam it. The shower is bad. The check in process is not stated at all and the host was slow to respond. For example, they responded to my request for the correct phone number at 11pm - check in was at 2pm, 7 hours earlier. There is a high pitched noise that went on all night.<br/><br/>The best thing I have to say about this is it is in a great location, right in Chinatown."
4839,462110,2019-03-15,Clell is a WONDERFUL HOST: very friendly and caring. The place is fairly clean and convenient with regards to accesses to Brooklyn(35min) and Manhattan(1h). Highly recommended to anyone who is looking for a quiet place to lay down as you hustle out in the city during the day. (you’re in a treat!)
4840,697746,2019-07-13,"Mona is an amazing host! She is super responsive and her apartment is beyond beautiful. I will definitely be back here again, loved my stay!!"
4841,592527,2019-11-19,Overall satisfactory! <br/>Was able to be fully relaxed the whole stay.<br/>This particular room was kept constantly heated. <br/>Didn't have any problem with noise from other rooms. <br/>Walgreens and train within short walking distance was great.

It was totally clean and we had everything we needed. We will definitely come back again.<br/><br/>Der Aufenthalt bei David in Brooklyn war sehr angenehm. In der Nähe befindet sich eine U-Bahn Station und sehr viele Einkaufsmöglichkeiten. Das Viertel ist viel größer als gedacht, nehmt euch Zeit und erkundet es. Das Apartment war sehr sauber und man hat alles was man brauch. Wir würden jederzeit wieder kommen."

4848,470653,2019-03-09,Stop Scrolling and Book!! I booked Cordelia’s house as a place for me and my bridal party to get ready for my wedding - my experience was exceptional from beginning to end. I booked two nights and slept over the night before my big day. 1st her house is beautiful and so clean. 2nd Cordelia and her husband came to greet me during the check-in process which was seamless and surprised me with Champagne and the sweetest congratulatory card. I was beyond impressed and the house helped make my day perfect for me and my bridal party. It was comfortable and great rooming accommodations. You won’t regret booking here.
4849,613793,2021-04-26,great place. worth the price.

4857,224708,2019-04-28,An amazing location right across the street from Fort Greene Park while nobody in that area offers ANYTHING even remotely close to her price!!!
4858,809824,2020-07-07,"decent place, but floor was dirty.  Walked out the room and a strange looking individual looking doped up was sitting on the couch."
4859,774791,2019-10-13,"This apartment is in a very convenient location and the host is very, very friendly and accommodating! Such a good place to stay for a weekend or so. Hopefully I will be back soon!"
4860,687843,2020-11-28,Great place. No TVs in the rooms. Parking was bad. Sam was a great host the apartment was very clean and cozy.
4861,869561,2021-09-06,"The place is smaller than it seems based on the pictures, but for the area it’s in its a clean decent place, and at a good price. My biggest complaint is that there’s no parking at the hotel. the place they directed us to was across the street, but would cost us $200 for two nights. We were able to find a place that would cost just $160. That’s new york I guess, but it would’ve been nice if we didn’t need to carry our luggage three blocks to the hotel and back."
4862,405308,2021-10-06,Great stay and amazing location! House was very clean and well equipped. Will definitely stay here again. Viviana and Fred are great hosts who communicate promptly and clearly.
4863,667586,2019-05-31,Nice clean space. Comfortable bed.
4864,560818,2019-10-02,A beautiful appartment in a great and safe area. I felt home for sure! The hosts are great people :)
4865,755707,2021-07-05,"Cute and clean. The space looks just like the pictures, close to where I needed to go. Private, didn’t see other guests that were there. Check in was easy. Great value"
4866,805576,2021-05-07,Host was nice but was not accommodating at all. She refused the stay because of her dislike of weed smoke on clothing DURING CHECK IN. Very Christian household that you’re going to have respect or she’ll tell you to cancel and keep your money.
4867,838001,2021-04-30,This place is awesome! Perfect for if you take the train and is always alive around the airbnb. Keith is very generous and communicative! Would stay again.
4868,309809,2019-07-13,"Jonathan's place was great. I was looking for a quiet, clean, well-located apartment to work and write, and it was perfect for this. <br/><br/>The apartment is filled with interesting books, art, and personal touches from Jonathan's travels and it's a good vibe to be around.<br/><br/>The location is amazing - right next to the park, near a lot of great restaurants, and in a super friendly and safe neighborhood. <br/><br/>Jonathan himself went above and beyond as a host - allowing me to check out a bit late, helping me with my (many) bags despite his just getting off of a flight, and always responding very quickly to any questions I had. <br/><br/>I was looking for a retreat within the city, and this apartment was exactly that, so thank you Jonathan!"
4869,591737,2019-05-18,"This was a comfy place to stay with many restaurants, grocery & other stores to walk to.  Also just a couple of blocks to the train.  The hosts were very responsive to any questions I had & you have your own private entrance/exit."
4870,844170,2021-08-14,The Zen Retreat is so nice and felt like I was at home. And Andrea is very consistent and communicative. Thank you again! I will most definitely come back when I visit New York again!
4871,736900,2020-06-08,Although there isn't a kitchen your're close to all restaurants and a shopping strip.
4872,449248,2020-01-01,Good if you don‘t mind music playing.
4873,880977,2021-11-28,Great stay.
4874,870410,2021-07-02,"There was many things wrong with the stay. First, we never met a Denise so we don’t know what that was about at all if you exist or wether you even live at the apartment. The roommate was the only contact we had and that was sketchy to say the least. The room was dirty the sheets didn’t appear to be washed at all, there was stuff all over the room, the mirror was disgusting you couldn’t even see your own reflection. The bathroom was so gross, the bathtub has never been cleaned, the shower rug  was disgustingly dirty it had all kinds of stains. The entire apartment was not cleaned, the kitchen was very dirty and we had no garbage bin or anywhere to dump or trash or toiletries."
4875,706301,2020-12-07,Place was great and neat. Each room had its own thermostat (great feature) . Neighborhood felt safe.
4876,117519,2019-05-25,Staying with Steph was great. She was very responsible and flexible to accommodate to our needs. We had a lovely experience.

4878,450158,2021-07-07,"Amazing stay! Katarina is super nice and responsive. The place is extremely clean, equipped and comfortable. There are super markets, delis, coffee shops and pretty much everything you need quite close. It’s a 10-12 min walk to the train (L and M). 10/10 I would definitely recommend it and go back."
4879,831459,2020-12-16,"Nice place to stay, everything was clean."
4880,169935,2019-07-24,Excellent value. Highly recommended. Quick communication and pleasant hosts.
4881,703674,2019-06-08,Easy to check in via keysafe. Beautiful interior space with lots of room. Super convenient for the subway. David’s brisket house down the street serves amazing sandwiches. Very reasonably priced for NYC. What more could you want?
4882,691748,2020-02-02,"Todo en orden, únicamente la parte del tax, podrías reservar algo más céntrico al mismo precio, la atención del recepcionista súper!"
4883,745455,2020-01-20,So cute! Perfect for our family! Loved the location. Amazing grocery store and everything else you could possibly need right outside the door. Hosts were always attentive and ready to help with anything we needed.

Everything is exactly what I expected and the pictures do a great job showing some of the unique touches and attention to detail that was put into making my stay comfortable.

4889,666857,2021-02-15,"For a quick, unexpected trip to the city staying at Luis’ was great! The space itself was cozy and comfortable. It is full of classic NYC charm that can’t be replicated and you get a sense of what it really feels like to be a New Yorker. Definitely would recommend if you want to stay in a cozy space that immerses you in a true NY experience."
4890,635706,2019-05-05,Very conveniently located and cute little flat. Close to subway so you can be in central Manhattan in 20m.

4894,600533,2019-12-22,Very cozy space and wonderful hosts! Check-in was smooth and easy and they were very responsive. We weren’t around the loft too much but when we were they were incredibly hospitable and played great music. The room was great for two people and the beds were comfortable. The location was also perfect for us and the train stop was just a short walk away.

4896,781233,2019-12-15,Cute place & sparkling clean!
4897,432217,2021-09-12,"Great location, okay place.  It has everything you need for your stay. However, it could use some TLC and a few things need to be fixed (bathroom door doesn't shut/latch, wobbly dining table, ceiling fan needs adjusting, etc). If the owners take care of these simple fixes it will make the place that much more enjoyable and comfortable to stay in. <br/>We were away from the cottage most of our stay, so these issues weren't the end of the world, but definitely annoying to not be able to close the bathroom door, for example."
4898,618007,2019-06-30,I had a wonderful stay! Super nice gentleman! I had no issues whatsoever with my stay and hope to stay there again soon!

4903,607823,2021-10-10,Shannon's place is very spacious and tastefully decorated. Everything is so clean. The beds are super comfortable (likely the most comfortable I have come across in all my airbnb stays) and the linens have the nice clean smell and feel. The house is in a convenient location with a short walk to subway and shops and restaurants. It is not far from Prospect Park where one can have a walk or run.
4904,597017,2019-03-06,"Charlene est une hotesse remarquable. Elle prendra le soin de vous laisser toutes les petites info pratique pour un sejour à NYC. Elle sera très disponible pr toute demande, sans oublier que son appart est aussi propre et conforme aux photos. Je recommande vivement"

4910,668984,2019-09-25,"I would highly recommend Miki and this place. Everything you need in a great part of town. The only drawback is if you're not used to city noises at night. The window is slightly open due to the window air conditioner so almost all noises outside are clearly heard, and there are a lot."
4911,684069,2021-11-05,This place is just a couple of trainstops into Manhattan in a safe and quiet neighborhood. Carlos and Carmen were wonderful hosts and their place has everythingone would need for a trip to NYC. i would definitely stay here again. I wish I had more time to soend here.

4914,187669,2019-11-03,"Мы остановились у Карен на 8 дней в конце октября .Квартира маленькая, но уютная . Есть все необходимое и даже больше. Очень удобное расположение от метро , в 3х минутах ходьбы. Рядом есть супермаркеты и другие магазины. До Манхеттена 20 минут на поезде. Было немного холодно в квартире , когда на улице похолодало. Отопление включалось днём на несколько часов, чтобы прогреть квартиру, но потом выключалось. Поэтому утром было холодно. Но в целом , это отличная квартира для тех, кто предпочитает активный отдых и прогулки на весь день по городу , а спать в мягкой кровати уютной квартиры. Спасибо большое, Карен"

The studio is smaller than it seemed in the pictures, but it was well equipped, had strong AC, and is well maintained. Our only complaints were that it was unclear from the listing that the apt. is below street level, but we really didn't feel it during our time. Highly recommend!"
4922,340163,2020-01-04,"Marion's place was a pleasure to visit. The location and views are great, and the apartment is exactly as described in the listing. I would stay there again!"

4927,881007,2021-11-29,"Fantastic apartment! Amelia was a wonderful host, always in touch and responsive to every little thing. The full bar was really an unexpected bonus. The concierge for the building was ever so nice. Location could not be better, very close to Central Park and all the cultural attractions of the mid-town and Upper West Side (Lincoln Center chief amongst them). The subway is a 5 minute walk and takes you anywhere you want to go in NYC in minutes. And after many long walks in Manhattan, I appreciated the many streaming services available to watch when I crashed;-)<br/>A perfect place to stay for my college student son and I during the holidays. I will be back again soon..."

4935,367188,2019-07-07,"We were three families of 5 adults and 5 children between 5 and 9 years. We rent the two apartments for 4 nights and it was perfect for us. The apartments where clean and tidy at arrival. We had breakfast and made some easy cooking for dinner at our stay. The Wifi was fast and good enough for five children streaming movies on iPads. Towels and bed linen wwere included. There are a lot of really good restaurants from 5 to 15 minutes’ walk from the location. The subway station is 4-5 minutes from the location, and it takes you to South Manhattan under 20 minutes. I highly recommend this accommodation."

4947,542151,2019-10-07,"Semih's place is located in a very central location and very close to the subway. He was a very generous host and I enjoyed my interactions and conversations with him. The home is very large and although I was rarely home, it certainly has a great vibe. Thanks for a great stay!"
4948,771129,2020-02-24,"The place was very nice, very quiet and clean. I really liked how everything was decorated, it really made you feel at home. Highly recommend."
4949,850706,2021-10-24,Great location and cozy place
4950,608396,2019-05-21,Such a nice place to stay in NY!
4951,837753,2021-04-01,"If y’all’re looking for somewhere to stay near Times Square, this is the absolute best place you can choose outside of the fancy hotels. It was clean and massive {for NY :) } . Unfortunately, this was my first stay with Airbnb and we ended up checking out at the wrong time so sorry Elias. There’s food less than 5 feet away from the door and so many restaurants to choose from on the street. The subway is pretty close too. Parking is not really a thing but that’s the case for all of Manhattan. This was an amazing air bnb!! Thankyou!!"
4952,485850,2021-05-30,"A serious great find for the area. Easy bus ride to new world mall with easy access there to get to Manhattan, etc. Clean, private bathroom, seriously a good experience."
4953,552381,2019-04-03,The very Best of hospitality
4954,851490,2021-04-08,Great stay. Would come back!
4955,369711,2019-10-21,"Nice clean place,  located a block way from subway."
4956,626223,2021-03-16,"Prav’s place was great! Good location and a clean space. Our keys didn’t work when we came back on the first night, which was the only concern. However Prav gave us a new set of keys that worked for the rest of our stay."
4957,679542,2019-08-24,"A clean towel, a comfortable bed, a safe neighborhood, and an accommodating host are all here. What more could you ask for? Tv? Oh yea she’s got that too! Definitely worth staying here I’d say."
4958,521759,2021-07-05,Es un lugar bueno para persons que no se estarán mucho tiempo en casa. El sitio no es muy seguro y menos para mujeres solas. Si buscas mas comodidad no es sitio para ti.
4959,567327,2020-01-05,"Anyone looking for a place to stay and want peace and relaxation, this is the place to get. The two times I’ve been there, I always feel at home!"
4960,291803,2019-03-09,Thanks for a great stay!
4961,763508,2021-10-17,Great location near all the restaurants and cafes of east village and close to subway. Easy check in and checkout process and great rooftop! Would definitely stay again
4962,799171,2020-10-27,"Wow! What can I say, the best airbnb I have ever stayed at. My partner and I stayed here for 2 nights and 3 days and it was amazing! The ambiance was so nice, the room and apartment was very clean. Geetanjali's hospitality was superb! I would highly recommend anyone staying here if visiting NYC!"
4963,435545,2019-08-06,"We throughly enjoyed our stay! The space is comfortable and very inviting. It is walking distance to a couple of subway lines, so getting into Manhattan was a breeze. We will def consider staying here again!"
4964,539648,2019-11-18,"Carla is a very nice host. I did not meet her husband.  <br/>The room is smaller then it seems in the picture and the closet was locked when I was there, so I did not have a place to hang the clothes I needed during my stay.  Not enough space on the floor to keep the suitcase open while using the room either, unless in bed.  No designated place in the bathroom for my towel and clothes while in the shower, the livingroom off limits. I felt that my presence was a nuisance.<br/>The room is right next to the entrance door, and adjacent to the bathroon, which is convenient.  However, there is no door between this part of the apartment and the livingroom.  The second night, very tired after a day in the outdoors, I went to sleep early but was unable to fall asleep for a long time due to the fact that the TV was on.<br/>The room was clean. The bathroom was clean, but had a white rug, which on day two was no longer clean."
4965,694512,2021-11-01,"This place is amazing! It looks better than in the pictures and the location is perfect with the subway about two minutes away by foot. The size is super comfortable for 4 people and the amenities were perfect for what we needed. Jason was a great host and the small and rare issues that we encountered were solved rapidly. I will be recommending this place to my friends and family, and when I'm back in NY I will definitely stay here again!!"
4966,486401,2021-01-16,"We really enjoyed our stay! There was plenty of room in the apartment, and because the bedroom is in the middle, it was very quiet and dark at night, which was great for sleeping (and definitely not a given in NYC). We also loved being so close to plenty of restaurants and Brooklyn Bridge Park, as well as groceries, coffee, etc."
4967,886720,2021-10-02,"The place is amazing! Clean and well located, we were so well received by the hosts! Definitely recommend this place"
4968,799693,2021-11-21,5 out of 5. Place was very clean. Best bang for your buck.
4969,779824,2021-07-15,"Great location, beautiful surroundings, wonderful and attentive hospitality from Stuart and Joel, and a view you can’t take your eyes off of! The Nest was a fantastic home base for my first visit to NYC!"
4970,779402,2019-12-08,"This place is absolutely wonderful. I mean the floors were warm when you would step out of bed! How amazing! The communication was really fast, the place was super clean and the area is 2 blocks down from the subway! I 10/10 recommend."
4971,322752,2019-11-23,"The location is really awesome, one of the best way to enjoy the beautiful nights at East village!"
4972,557853,2019-08-01,I loved staying here. Giovanni was very accommodating with a late check-in and it was easily the best place for the price that I’ve been at in NYC. There are super friendly turtles in the kitchen who are awesome. I’ll stay here every chance I get.
4973,806109,2021-10-16,"If you are looking for a location close to trains - this is great, about an 8 minute walk to station. Many great restaurants nearby and on site laundry was a huge convenience!"
4974,553109,2021-08-26,"La ubicación del departamento es excelente. Cerca a todo. La habitación es pequeña pero tiene justo lo que una persona necesita, tiene aire acondicionado bueno, una pequeña refrigeradora, televisión y la conexión a internet es estupenda. Los anfitriones respondieron mi llamada y mensajes rápidamente."

4977,641444,2021-07-06,"Tina’s place is stunning. The space was open, clean and bright.<br/><br/>The location is conveniently close to the L train which helped us get around so easily. And the restaurants and bars in Bushwick were beautiful!<br/><br/>We were fortunate enough to to run into Tina on our way in and throughout our trip, she was so kind and helpful. Would highly recommend!"
4978,501823,2019-10-14,"A wonderfully located apartment. Beautiful and quiet. Nice room. The private bathroom is just outside the door of the bedroom, not inside. So a night robe is useful. Need to wait a few minutes for the hot water to arrive, but manageable. Nice and helpful doorman. Good Ramen & Sake place on Lexington & 39th . Good shuttle in the subway : S train straight to Times square. Used it a lot, to get to the theatre district & upper West side. Over all an excellent place to stay. I will come again"
4979,396088,2019-05-23,The best place I have ever stayed！

4983,880776,2021-08-21,"Asad's place is immaculately clean and comfortable. It's nicely decorated and furnished, in a very quiet family neighborhood that makes this a perfect place if you are visiting for a Mets game, checking out interesting neighborhoods, or want an affordable, great value for going into Manhattan. We would definitely return!"
4984,530548,2019-05-24,"Brilliant location, nice friendly neighborhood and easy to check in!"
4985,669003,2019-05-28,"Buen lugar para alojarse, cómodo y un buen anfitrión."
4986,640091,2019-05-28,"The apartment was beautiful, really close to the Utica subway station, which took you to Manhattan in 20mins, and had everything we needed. We had a lovely stay and would totally recommend!"
4987,153590,2019-07-17,"If you are looking for a getaway while you experience the big city, Jonathan's place is for you! Located in a diverse and fun neighborhood only minutes to the subway, this place provides a calm, quiet, spacious, and clean place to catch your breath from the pace of Manhattan. Jon provides a binder of great local eats and things to do in Brooklyn. This neighborhood has amazing food and is minutes from the Brooklyn Bridge, the Brooklyn flea markets (weekends), and shopping in Williamsburg and downtown Brooklyn. I highly recommend this affordable and accessible unit. Thanks Jon."
4988,564982,2019-07-23,"Excellent host. Clean, and beautifully retro-styled home. Our bedroom was minimalist furnished, with a beautiful ensuite bathroom and a king-sized bed. Pleasant choice of toiletories."

4990,685042,2021-10-14,"Francisco is an amazing host and we loved our stay. He went above and beyond for us, even got us tickets for the Met on our last day and let us stash our luggage for the afternoon. The room was great, bed was comfortable, and space had wonderful art and vibe. Neighborhood was perfect and close to everything. We appreciated Francisco’s thoughtfulness and great conversations— would absolutely recommend and stay again."
4991,874429,2021-08-01,Great place to stay! Responsive host and team. Great roommates who are respectful and friendly. Home is clean and the room was as described. Plenty of good food options nearby. Close subway access. Thanks!

4994,444089,2019-08-08,"Stephen's garden apartment is light, comfortable, and safe. It is in a wonderful location for walking to the water, shopping, movies, restaurants and several buses and subway lines. I have grown to love this neighborhood for all these reasons. I have stayed here in both the winter and summer and both heating and air conditioning systems are great. The kitchen has supplies for meal prep and there are several markets in very close walking distance. Easy to rest up here and enjoy Brooklyn, Manhattan, and where ever your travels take you."
4995,487535,2021-09-23,"I was supposed to stay on the 4th floor but I stayed on the 1st so this review is for the 1st floor. Check in was really easy, the place was clean, a nice breeze was coming in, and it was relatively quiet. The location is perfect for visiting Coney Island. The best part of this stay was the shower. Sounds silly but the water pressure and hot water was better than at my own house. Definitely recommend staying in one of the units they have available."
4996,684286,2019-12-31,"I really enjoyed staying at your house even if it was for only 8-9hours, I was really confortable in this environment."
