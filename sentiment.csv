750009,35718438,2019-06-30,This is  a lovely apartment in a great location in the East Village.  Sammie was a super host and was flexible and quick to respond to questions.  This is a sizable one bedroom apartment that is nicely furnished (looks like the photos).  The apartment was very clean upon our arrival.  The only downside is that the only air conditioning is a window unit in the bedroom that on a hot day runs just about all the time.  The other rooms stayed very warm.
449042,16333607,2019-09-01,Stayed at Chris’ apartment with a colleague during a conference. Greenpoint is such a great neighbourhood and the apartment really is a gem. We had a supercomfortable stay and Chris was always available for questions. Highly recommended!!
782915,39369799,2021-10-24,Absolutely beautiful studio in a very quiet and safe Brooklyn neighborhood.  As described!  Our flight landed extra late but the communication with Jelena was superb which made checking in and out a breeze!! Will stay there again for sure!!

781590,39229191,2019-12-15,Great comfortable place especially for A family visiting. The water views are amazing and the apt. Is spacious and open. Carmine responds quickly and helps with issues I had. Parking is not an issue as it is everywhere else in the BX. Oh and did I say the water views are spectacular. Overall I will be checking here first always when I have to visit NY which is every other month.
684834,30441211,2020-09-29,"It’s one of the best Airbnb experience ever! And Lancelot is the best host ever. He takes care about all details and all requests. You may find everything in the room what you need - sleeping masks, water, chargers, lots of devices and etc. I just mentioned that it will be nice to have the blackouts on the windows and the next day I have them! <br/>Very thoughtful and caring host! <br/>And the place is amazing, very beautiful and stylish! Perfectly clean and comfortable! The area is quite and perfectly located!"

299544,8704528,2019-11-01,"I have stayed twice at Marjorie's lovely apartment in the interesting small Brooklyn neighborhood of Redhook.  It is conveniently located to get a ferry, subway, or bus uptown or to other parts of Brooklyn, a few steps away from a bunch of small restaurants, cafes, and interesting boutiques, and a few minutes away from a lovely little park with a great view of the Hudson River and the Statue of Liberty.  The apartment is very well appointed, clean, lovely furniture, good lighting, spacious and welcoming.  The bed was comfortable, the kitchen has everything you could need, and the bathroom is great.  Marjorie is a good and timely communicator, answered all questions, met me in person for check in, and was clear but flexible in meeting my specific needs and requests.  This is a quiet and peaceful retreat to  enjoy and return to in the midst of a busy often hectic visit to the Big Apple!"

We had 6 people and an infant staying here and never felt cramped. The apartment was very clean and exactly as pictured. The location made it an easy ride from LaGuardia airport and a simple subway ride into Manhattan. Astoria itself has a lot to offer and the food within walking distance to the apartment is fantastic. <br/><br/>We were in town to attend a wedding and celebrate my daughter's 6th birthday. Nadine was so wonderful that she even brought by daughter a cupcake and balloon on her birthday. I couldn't believe how thoughtful she was. Anyone looking for a great place to stay in the city would be luck to stay here."

582731,22665286,2019-11-05,"Antonis' place was great. It was very clean and cozy. It is about a 10 minutes walk to the 7 train (which gets you to most of Manhattan), and there are many food places and grocery stores nearby. Great price point for the four of us since there are three bedrooms and two full bathrooms. The only minor downside is that the bathrooms are not on the main floor. I would definitely consider staying here again if I am in the area. The house is near LaGuardia airport, so it didn't cost us much to get to the house. Also, thank you Antonis for letting us check out a little later."

275974,7837816,2021-06-21,"We had an excellent time staying at Edgar's place. He was very calm, welcoming, and knowledgeable -- and Digi was the sweetest kitty cat! There was another person staying in spare bedroom that was very quiet and kept to himself. The place looks just like the pictures (very clean), the bed was comfortable, and the AC kept us nice and cool in the afternoons and evenings. The filtered water tank and access to the kitchen was a huge plus, as well! Overall: Would stay here again. 10/10"
660521,28692232,2019-01-12,"This place was the perfect AirBnB setup. The rooms are upstairs with a bathroom and kitchen. The room was perfect with a nice big TV and Netflix on the ready.

697568,31513692,2019-11-21,"This Airbnb is probably the best value you can get in NYC. Kyoko was a very nice host and the apartment had a nice atmosphere in general. There's a subway and buses close by and it was very easy to commute around Manhattan/Brooklyn (probably more, but those are the places I mostly hung out at). The area itself feels safe enough, I came home a few times during 1-4am and never felt unsafe. Don't really have any complaints, especially for the price."
647193,27703666,2019-07-25,这个民宿是我民宿经历中，性价比最高，房东最热情的一个。位置，环境，卫生，设施，都很好。突出的是人品和性价比，我会介绍所有的人，到纽约体验Richard的房源。

205311,4532913,2021-05-30,Prime location in Williamsburg. Got everything you need at Oliver’s place. Close to the L train. A walk away from everything that is happening. Oliver is super friendly and nice and is a great host!
370280,12806940,2019-04-01,"The pictures do not do this place justice, it looks even better! The books, the art, the decor, the plants, everything is perfect. This place also has the best shower tucked in between two full body mirrors, with double shower heads. The space is almost unbelievable for New York, between the living room, patio, spacious bedrooms, and double bathrooms. Plus, there are twenty-four hour delis that are walking distance, and a drive/Lyft/Uber into the city is only a few minutes. You really feel immersed in the NYC culture, specifically the Brooklyn/Brown Stone culture -- it's truly an authentic experience. Be mindful of the house rules, specifically keeping the noise down, especially after 10 PM. Quiet hours are stressed to show respect for tenants that live in the building. Also, very small things, there was no microwave, and the stove/oven was not working properly during our stay. We could not figure out how to connect our phones to the speakers to play music, but it was for the best because again, it is imperative that noise is kept to a minimum. Walls are very thin. Lastly, keep your shoes off while walking around and bring socks or house shoes, the floors creak and if you're walking around wearing heels or sneakers it'll make your steps louder.<br/><br/>I would definitely recommend staying here, 12/10. Again, just be respectful and honor the quiet hours and other house rules and you will truly enjoy your stay!"
506975,19192149,2019-09-09,"Great place, clean, close to Subway and stores. The hosts were amazing !"

This place would be good for a single traveler or a couple, either in town for business or for fun.  The immediate neighborhood is walkable, full of restaurants and bars, and even a grocery store. The stairs to the apartment would be a challenge for someone with mobility issues, but otherwise this spot is a steal!"
495269,18606237,2019-04-07,The place is about 15 mins walking from the free ferry to Manhattan and it's in a quiet neighbourhood on Staten Island. The room is just like the pictures and the house has its own charm.<br/>Reuben the host is very responsive and extremely flexible. He checked me in at 1 AM and showed me all the amenities. I was very much impressed with the whole experience. Thanks for the great stay!
226098,5433746,2019-01-05,"Appartement lumineux et idéalement situé proche de 2 stations de métro sur des lignes différentes, entre 5 et 10 min à pied. <br/>Parfait pour rejoindre Manhattan et l'aéroport JFK. <br/>Un hôte très réactif et très disponible. <br/>Un séjour idéal qui malgré les efforts de Francis à distance aurait été parfait avec du chauffage !... <br/>Malgré ce contretemps je recommande le lieu !"
680662,30143717,2019-08-08,A beautiful apartment in a great location. Two big bedrooms with two bathrooms - very convenient for a family (especially with teenagers). Dan and Laura were very responsive and always positive for everything that we asked. Highly recommended!

879081,51059798,2021-09-17,"The apartment was really clean and well appointed feeling. It definitely is a bit small but exactly as the pictures show so no surprises. and the space is used very well so it is quite functional. There is also some additional storage above the closets that is helpful for getting things out of the way. If your are there as two people, know it is kind of a squeeze to get around the bed but it worked ok for us. <br/><br/>Vibe was also very easy to get in contact with by email or phone (a person actually picks up!) and for the few things that came up they quickly addressed them without any push back. They were also very helpful in accommodating an extension in our stay."
857210,48711194,2021-08-22,"Staying at Ryan’s was great and right in the heart of Greenpoint. Easy access to best restaurants, fun running, etc. Apartment is spacious but simple and perfect for a few days in Brooklyn"
449274,16346527,2019-05-12,Thank you Mei for a great first experience with Airbnb. Your home was perfectly located for my needs. The bedrooms in the back of the house made for a quiet nights sleep even with the window open for fresh air. Mei allows for as much or as little interaction as you need and is always a pleasure to have a conversation with. I would definitely book with you again. Thank you!
612018,24823404,2021-03-15,"I wouldn’t consider this place for anyone who’s looking to stay without tv , bathroom being used by other Tenants wide open , as well if you are not bother by tenants and host being in your business . As the place is SUPER QUITE AND feel your just being watched and listen to from outside your own Door . <br/>I suggest go somewhere else honestly . If your homeless this is a place for you other than that I personally would not recommend this place to any of my family or friends ."

122092,1688914,2019-08-31,"Loved the stay! Joy is a fantastic host and the apartment is great. It’s spacious and full of light, private and comfortable. It’s not the newest or fanciest place you’ll find but it gives you a taste of comfortable New York life and that’s hard to find. This place is a good value for the price, I stayed here very happily for a full month in the August heat."
486267,18155063,2021-08-17,"Great stay, thank you Jenifer!"
669173,29384622,2019-07-21,Extremely comfortable bed and cozy apartment. Casey was always quick to respond and had a nice list of local spots. Easy to get to the subway stations from where the apartment is located as well.
788618,39919890,2019-11-17,"Great value. Close to the subway and buses. Clean, cozy room. Nice building. No complaints. Meridith was not physically present but was always easy to reach communication-wise. Check-in instructions were comprehensive and clear. Really enjoyed my Brooklyn weekend!"
847260,47359733,2021-09-25,Elizabeth is great and so is her place! She was very helpful with suggestions on things to do and just an all around great person. Her place is close to the subway and there is a lot of great food and drink in the area as well!
393228,13761271,2021-04-15,The place was in a good location for my job! Perfect for a short stay. The walls are very thin so you can hear every conversation/noise in the surrounding rooms and the apartment downstairs. That was the only major con to my stay.
618841,25309799,2019-01-12,"A wonderful space, in a great location, clean and cozy, it is everything you could ask for. Jade is an amazing host. Made me feel right at home. Would definitely stay here again."

642055,27338033,2019-03-17,Keilyn’s place was great! It was about a 7 minute walk to the subway station. We arrived early and were able to drop our bags off in the living room until our check in time. We felt comfortable for our entire stay. Thanks Keilyn!
481463,17938337,2019-07-23,"Great that it is close to JFK and Kathleen has equipped this little studio very well. Kathleen was quick to respond to questions and went the extra mile checking bus and train timetables. Getting to Brooklyn and Manhattan was more challenging than I’d anticipated. Good value, and we got to experience the diversity and warm heartedness of Carnasie that most visitors don’t get to see."
775202,38483199,2020-01-28,If ur on the fence or reading thru a million zillion reviews before choosing u can safely stop now & book w Francesco <br/><br/>We needed a last minute nights stay & he responded super quick & was very kind to let us check in last minute.<br/><br/>Upon arrival we noticed immediately that place smelled incredibly clean & that the set up was very private considering it’s a large space. <br/><br/>We appreciated all of his extra touches & even his sweet set up of getting his guests a discount at some local eateries.<br/><br/>All in all a great pick & it’s never a guarantee it will be so we r very grateful for the amount of effort he puts into his listing. <br/><br/>We will book again when we need another stay. <br/><br/>Thanks again !
473004,17539385,2019-09-17,"Nous avons passés un super séjour à NYC, nous reviendrons dès que possible! La vue de la terrasse est juste dingue, ça me manque déjà!"
556411,21541423,2019-06-30,"The location is very nice because you are in between two subway stations. It still takes about 30 minutes through subway to get into the city, but it was still nice to explore. If you visit during the summer, just beware that the AC usually only chills the room that you are in and not the entire apartment. However, Karen is a very nice host!"
840524,46585974,2021-09-07,"very accommodating, nice and clean, close to everything"
378511,13216357,2019-04-10,"Honestly, the value of this property is what made our trip possible. There was only a few issues we had when it came to the comfort of our stay. <br/>The train is a bit further than we thought it would be. The walk was mostly well lit and didn’t feel unsafe. Just longer and uphill to get to the train that takes you downtown.<br/><br/>We didn’t have water on the 4th day of our stay. It trickled out of the faucet and the shower wouldn’t turn on at all. It was also the day of our anniversary and we couldn’t bathe before our night out. Not fun, especially for my husband who showers twice a day. The next day, the day of our departure. The water was running but had no hot water.  Once again, no shower before our flight home.<br/><br/>All in all, the bed was comfortable and the place was affordable."

770072,37914207,2021-05-30,"Really nice studio. Super clean and nicely decorated with super soft towels and nice amenities. The good news is that there are several really nice restaurants and a wine bar--all with outdoor seating--right outside the door. That also means that they can be active late into the evening so may be some evening revelers. Great location, and with Union Station only a couple of blocks away, you can get anywhere in the city or Brooklyn easily. Enjoy the city easily from here!"

The host are very polite and respond when needed. Only complaint is there is no tv, so if you’re expecting to watch something, best bring a labtop!"
887739,52207849,2021-10-07,Morian was very helpful when we had questions about anything from asking where towels were to asking for food recommendations. The room was actually a lot bigger than we thought. The desk is perfect for people working from home. The apartment is around a lot of popular spots too! The room is facing the street tho - and Manhattan Ave is quite a busy street. But it’s fine if you don’t mind noise and can fall asleep easily.
360710,12272376,2019-06-07,"What a unique and fun place. Enjoyed a little escape from the city just a few blocks from the subway! Enjoyed the beach and boardwalk nearby too. Thank you, Ben!"

800191,41353712,2021-03-11,So nice of German to provide super great coffee and a Chemex! Place is absolutely spotless and has great light. Just know that the cheap price is because of the location. It’s not NYs nicest neighborhood
420729,15052455,2021-07-18,"Such a wonderful location, beautiful room, and overall Kimberly had such a fun energy that made you feel welcomed to stay. My friend and I came for a few days to unwind and that’s exactly what this place allowed us to do.

It was also so close to the subway, so we loved that it was easy to commute places :-) please stay here! You won’t regret it"

227464,5519207,2020-02-10,Place was amazing! Location definitely was not exactly what we expected but just be aware of your surrounding and you’ll be great. Close to multiple things but a little far from downtown (subways are WONDERFUL things!)

They won't interfere with the guests thus we have a very comfortable stay. Highly recommended to all."

We will definitely be returning again to stay with him. <br/>We were given lots of privacy. I highly recommend staying here. The neighbourhood was safe, the local restaurants and bars were friendly and this was unbelievably reasonable price wise. It was the best value anywhere! <br/>We highly recommend this very, very, affordable accommodation."
723113,33835470,2019-12-24,"I stayed there with my boyfriend and we loved it! My boyfriend is a huge fan of Wes Anderson so the whole theme of the Airbnb being the Grand Budapest Hotel was awesome for him. <br/>The self-check in is really easy and it really helped us that we could leave our luggage there before our time to check-in. <br/>The place was very clean and comfy, even sharing the bathroom with other guests we didn’t have to wait once to use it and it was always very clean, even after someone used it. <br/>The location is really great too, about 5 minutes walk to the subway to go to Manhattan. <br/>Loved our stay there and would highly recommend!"

827905,45224909,2021-04-19,The location is fabulous. You can literally walk anywhere or hop on a metro nearby if needed. There’s also a Whole Foods two blocks away which is big plus. The place is very cozy and  reasonably quiet. The only complaint I have is the lack of outside view. But then again if you’re a visitor you shouldn’t be staying indoors anyways.
167508,3325617,2021-07-01,We had a great stay at Shawn and Christine's place! It was exactly as described and equipped with all the amenities we need. This place is a few minutes walk from 7 train which is very conveniently located to go to Manhattan and Flushing.

Утюг по просьбе легко предоставили, полотенце тоже можно поменять. Конечно, это не отель, смены белья ежедневной нет, но вряд ли кто-то остановится тут надолго, а даже если да, уверена, что можно попросить и об этом. Интернет иногда подвисал, но и эта проблема регулировалась обращением в офис."

Thank you again Francesco for making my stay comfortable and enjoyable!"
297131,8628425,2019-04-14,"Karen is the most delightful host. So welcoming and friendly and just absolutely lovely. Her three cats are also fun! The sleeping situation is a bit unusual as you would be sleeping in a mezzanine accessed via a ladder above the living room where Karen would be sleeping. If you are ok with that, it's a totally fine place to stay, and I had a great time there, and the family neighborhood of Park Slope is very pleasant too."

614896,24996332,2019-04-26,"To be honest, for the price it may be the best you can get in NY.<br/><br/>The room was very tidy and beautiful.<br/>Win puts alot of efford on trying to help their guests.<br/>He gives you a good breakfast that could save you both money and time.<br/><br/>It's about 15minutes away from LGA airport in Uber/Lyft.<br/>It's about15 minutes by walking to the closest subway station and 5 in Uber (which I recommend using because the surroundings of that subway station are kind of ugly).<br/>It will take you maybe 50 or 1 hour at most to get to Manhattan (5~10 Uber+45 subway)<br/><br/>I will definitely recommend the place."

50159,405025,2020-07-12,"While the stay was good, my guests and I did not appreciate that the host came down and knocked on the door every morning at 9am and did not stop until someone answered. We planned this trip to relax and sleep in late and it was annoying to be woken up every morning."
791815,40376349,2021-05-27,"Kamil's apartment is spacious, clean, and perfectly located! A short walk from all of Williamsburg's best parks and restaurants. Kamil himself was very accessible, and I hope to have the opportunity to visit again."

Still, the place was clean, the bed was very comfortable and you can't beat the location."

The apartment is in a great location in the West Village, I was alone, however, if you are staying with more than one person it is a bit tight, the second bed is a pull out couch.  Other than that would recommend for a city trip!"

752330,36102419,2021-10-18,"It was okay! It could have been better! When I usually go to Airbnb, there is usually a housekeeper cleaning after us, so expected that. Wanted us to wipe dishes down and put it away, wanted us to clean the tub preferably he said every 2-3 days and wanted us to take out garbage knowing that he is leaving the building anyway so he could’ve taken it out himself. And the “make sure there is no oil stain on sheets or else I’ll charge”, But then, gives us sheets that are mostly prone to oil stains…that ridiculous! But other than that, he is a nice guy!"

It is close to at least three subway lines and multiple excellent restaurants and local grocery stores. We loved the private terrace for breakfasts — with food Anita generously supplied — and evenings after a lot day seeing New York. The bonus is the music studio downstairs, where she and her husband host occasional concerts. Anita also sent us detailed directions from the airport and other tips that made everything easy."

512970,19528326,2019-08-18,"The Lou's appartment looks like web shows, is a typical Newyorker flat with wood floor and big windows. Perfect for couples. <br/><br/>The appartment is placed in a good residential area. You can take the subway at 23th or 28th station near the appartment, about 10 minutes on foot.<br/><br/>As a negative points:<br/><br/>- Tv's doesnt works, just Netflix.<br/>- Fresh air really annoying (it makes plenty of noise all time).<br/>- Hall and stairs before the entrance are old and dirty.<br/><br/>Anyway, We really enjoyed our stay there, the appartment allows a nice experience to you, which is the perfect extra point to get an authentic Newyorker trip! <br/><br/>Hugs from Spain!"

The subway and bus stops are within walking distance. I was there at the onset of winter and during the Covid 19 Pandemic. There was sufficient heat in the room and hot water in the faucet. There was disinfectant wipes available in the room. Joyce and her son Donovan are friendly, warm, and nice persons. Would stay with Joyce again if there is an opportunity."
666079,29100541,2021-11-02,"The room was clean, cozy, private, and nicely furnished.

Suket and Sunil were lovely and accommodating  hosts, and were even so generous to share some amazing homemade cheesecake! Fantastic communication and the option of a parking spot was a big plus. I would absolutely stay here again."

The room was big enough and you also have a code to get in, so we felt safe. The only note I have to say for others who consider this Airbnbis is that you can hear the noises from outside the building, wich was not a problem for us. <br/>The check-in/out went super easy.<br/>Thank you Elena for letting us stay at your place!

796152,40846105,2020-01-03,"We had a wonderful stay in Queens.  We rented one of the rooms to spend a few nights vacation in New York.   The location was perfect - an easy 5 minute walk to the subway (M train) which brought us to trendy Williamsburg and Manhattan.  What I also liked about the neighborhood was some cool mom and pop restaurants and cafes (Japanese, Thai, Polish, South American) all within walking distance.  The area felt safe with a mix of people from all over.  Also, it was relatively easy to find on street parking a few blocks away, without having to pay for daily parking which can be expensive in New York.   The space was newly renovated and modern - very comfortable bed, nice bathroom, and ample space.  The room had a desk, dresser, closet and good lighting, which made it easy to relax after a long day walking around.  Although we didn't cook, we had access to the newly renovated modern kitchen, which was a nice touch.  The host was friendly and provided some good tips on where to eat in the neighborhood.  I will definitely come back and stay at this place next time I visit NYC."

He had a lot of great tips and recommendations of the area and was happy to answer any questions I had. His location is a very short walk to the subway which makes getting around the city very easy. You get an exceptionally good taste of New York life and I couldn't be happier with how it turned out."
152901,2683758,2019-08-28,"John è un host ineccepibile: è stato molto presente per ogni dubbio durante tutto il soggiorno, rapido e disponibile nella comunicazione. Ha pensato a tutto, lasciandoci tutto l'occorrente per le colazioni nel suo appartamento. La casa è essenziale, così come descritta, c'è tutto quello che occorre per un breve soggiorno di coppia. La posizione molto comoda: servita da metro C e B, dietro central park in ogni caso; infine nella traversa 116 c'è un supermercato piuttosto fornito.<br/>In definitiva la sistemazione presenta un buon rapporto qualità/ prezzo, considerato i prezzi che girano a Manhattan."

71953,700916,2020-07-02,"We had a terrific stay at Gabriela & Nikko’s place! We had just moved back to NY from Los Angeles & needed a place to stay for a week before moving into our new home. This was the perfect oasis for us to rest after our journey. The apt is warm, inviting & in a terrific location. Gabriela was easy to connect with even while she was out of town with her family for the holidays. Quick responses & always accommodating and friendly. We love Bedstuy & throughly enjoyed sitting on the stoop, walking to the park & just exploring more of the neighborhood. This is the ideal spot to live like a local & only a quick train ride to the city. There are plenty of coffee shops, great restaurants & amazing parks within walking distance! The cozy apt has plenty of amenities including a comfy bed, the best shower & the cutest backyard! We also truly appreciated being able to stay with our dog, Nico. Always a challenge when looking for Airbnb’s. We will absolutely recommend our friends & family to stay here the next time they visit us! Thank you Gabriela & Nikki for your amazing hospitality! ☺️"

888511,52404057,2021-10-03,The place is nice for two people and i’d say the location is pretty nice. There’s a lot of restaurants to go to. Our overall experience wasn’t that great. The apartment itself was mostly clean when we arrived but it felt lived in. There was groceries  in the fridge and freezer. And the tub had some hairs that weren’t picked up. The toilet paper wasn’t replaced so there was less than half a role left. There was a tv in the room but the tv remote was no where to be found so we were unable to use the tv. I communicated to the host about all of  this but nothing was done about it. If the host could have a better communication with their guests then I’m sure the experience will be better
191652,4121363,2020-10-17,"First of all, Rachel is an amazing host! If you have any questions, Rachel is super friendly and replies quickly. Rachel's home is in a great location nearby coffee shops, restaurants, grocery stores, pharmacies, clothing stores, the subway station and more! Rachel's home has everything you need - wifi, cable TV, a full kitchen, washer/dryer, a private patio space, etc. I really enjoyed my stay here in Harlem!"

456017,16613747,2020-12-31,"My stay at Jonathan's place was enjoyable. It is exactly as advertised with eclectic decor and a clean furnishings. The apartment is conveniently located close to bodegas, restaurants and boutiques. And If you need to get to the city fast, it is just a quick L train ride away. Also, the host was adamant about following the regulations for the covid protocol, which made me feel safe and secure. I came with heavy bags of luggage and needed to hang my wardrobe. Jonathan graciously made space for me to store all of my many items. It was also nice that I could control the room temperature being that the temperature outside was not constant. Jonathan was lovely and gave many tips on where to eat and where to do laundry if need be. All in all,  my stay was great and I would recommend this place to others."
500111,18877341,2019-10-07,"Awesome apartment, pictures don’t do it justice! It is on the fourth floor so not super convenient if traveling with a lot and/or heavy bags, but otherwise really nice updated apartment with easy check-in, highly recommend it. I would love to stay there again!"

369336,12747935,2021-09-05,I almost don't want to say how much I enjoyed my stay because then this booking might get popular or something ;) <br/><br/>The accommodations were as promised and worth the cost. There was a big storm during my stay (hurricane season) and it was nice to kick back and watch TV since I couldn't go out. Everyone in the building did a good job cleaning up after themselves (myself included). I liked having a desk in the room because I worked remotely during my stay. I also appreciated the armoire and ironing board to keep my going out clothes cute and not wrinkly from my suitcase. <br/>Those touches made it feel like a hotel. <br/><br/>Overall I think Hurriyet shows that she has a lot of experience doing this through how the room is set up and definitely knows how to communicate and set expectations.
231508,5758234,2019-06-18,This place is awesome. It's very spacious and comfortably housed our group of 7. Highly recommend!
736325,34604981,2021-10-30,"I am very pleased that I stayed with Michaela.  There is a very nice area here, there are many shops and cafes nearby.  Very fun and lively on the streets.  The subway is nearby and you can quickly get to Manhattan.  The street where the house is located is quiet and calm.  The apartment is clean and comfortable.  It was very comfortable for me to live here.  The room has everything you need to arrange your things.  The kitchen is fully equipped with everything you need.  You can easily warm up your own food or cook something.  Nice bathroom.  Wi-Fi works great."

The location was perfect- walkable to Forest Hills Stadium and accessible to lots of food options. <br/><br/>Thank you, Cathy!"
68545,657727,2019-09-01,My partner and I stayed here for 4 nights in August. Mariko’s place was clean and had everything you needed! I will say that the only downfall was the cooling system- there was an AC unit in the bedroom but it was so loud that you couldn’t hear the TV. Everything else was great and was such a nice quiet location that is walkable distance to the museum of natural history and Central Park! We loved staying here :)

This place ended up being 2 minutes away from where I was meeting my friends.  <br/><br/>While I didn’t use much of the common area, the entire home was clean.  The bedroom was air conditioned and I slept comfortably.  The snacks in the kitchen were also perfect the next morning. <br/><br/>Gladwyn was a great host!  She responded quickly and was all around friendly.  I will definitely stay here again whenever I return to Brooklyn!"

61115,560078,2021-10-27,"Hard to believe a space like this exists in NY. The outdoor patio is truly special, I setup my laptop outdoor and basically loved outdoors. The attention to details and quality of items is also very good (bed and pillows). This is an amazing neighborhood too, full of awesome spots and close to many other great neighborhoods. Lastly, Vana is very friendly and attentive. Highly recommend his spot."

567690,21966432,2019-04-16,"This is a great place to stay for a couple or other traveling pair. Any more than two people might start to get a bit cramped, but for two people it's great. Good location in a very mellow, residential neighborhood that is close to the F & G trains that will take you into Manhattan and Queens (you can easily take the F to LaGuardia connecting to airport bus shuttle), Prospect Park, and nice local restaurants. The kitchen is tight but I'm not sure how much you'll need it; in general I think this studio is a good deal."
806121,42169326,2021-06-26,Marco is a very kind and reactive host. His place is very welcoming and clean. Stayed there about a month it was a really cool place no issues whatsoever.

820180,43956052,2020-11-05,"This was a terrible stay for 250$. Your customer service is terrible and while I was there their were flies in the shower drain, people smoking Marijuana in the hallways, and people not wearing masking while outside of their rooms through out the building. The owner wouldn’t accommodate me what do ever. Terrible place to stay. I advise you to not stay here ever especially if you have children. I was stuck here with my 3 year old daughter while all of these things were going on and her allergies flared up because of lol the flies coming from the shower drain."
764198,37198745,2021-07-10,"Chris is a wonderful host with an absolutely beautiful place! The bedrooms are spacious and comfortable. The patio is a perfect hang out spot.

Clear and kind communication throughout, Maurice even dropped off some fresh picked apples for us during our stay! <br/><br/>Easy entry with lockbox, great location in crown heights, clean apartment with large rooms. Short 5 min walk to the subway with convenient commute around Brooklyn or into the city. Overall this was a really wonderful place to land in NY, and my friend and I had an amazing trip. Recommend if you're looking for a home in BK!"
449995,16368328,2019-03-21,Thanks again for everything! It was so nice staying with them. They are really lovely and the room is definitely amazing. You need about 15 minutes with the subway to drive trough the times Square. So the location is perfect.

851869,47982995,2021-04-11,"A great place to stay if you know the city - it's a bit far from most tourist attractions, but very close to Central Park and near Columbia University. James was a very gracious and attentive host. It's a fun, quirky stay if you're easygoing!"
709818,32670715,2019-05-19,"Nice and cozy places especially you travel with children. The only problem is that the bedrooms doesn’t have thick curtain, the sunlight can easily get in."

270017,7603716,2020-03-01,"Book with absolute confidence! Jennifer’s place is even more lovely and welcoming than pictured. I have been Airbnb-ing around NYC for four months now and Jennifer’s place was the very best! <br/>It’s less than a block to the R train.  The neighborhood feels safe and I felt no apprehension about being on the street or either avenues at any time. There are plenty of drugstores, diners, pizza, coffee and gift shops about a half a block away, AND the view of the Verrazano Bridge that heaps even more charm on the Bay Ridge Area. It’s a short trip to Manhattan or Staten Island from here. <br/>Jennifer is a very accommodating and thoughtful host. The environment of the apartment is very comfortable and peaceful with great lighting; both natural & electrical. The bed and linens were of great quality and very comfortable. The kitchen is big, updated, and amply supplied. It was a huge advantage to have a washer & dryer in the unit that she kindly shares. If you need her, she responds quickly. If you don’t, you rarely see her and feel you have the place mostly to yourself. <br/>The building is a prewar that has been lovingly maintained and smartly updated. Entry and stairwell were secure, very clean, and well-lighted. <br/>If I ever need a room in NYC again I will be checking her availability first as it is the very best."
761627,37076027,2019-10-17,One of the best Airbnb’s I’ve ever been to- thanks so much!
851957,47994751,2021-08-29,The house was clean and comfortable.  Enjoyed our stay.  Aron was quick to reply with any questions we had.
814361,43161885,2021-02-06,Mellisa place was amazing! <br/>It was a home away from home but within an apartment. Only downside were the inconsiderate neighbors <br/>But other than that the place was great!
814623,43220447,2020-10-11,We stayed here for a long weekend! The place is a perfect size and located in one of the best neighborhoods in Brooklyn. Super close to the park and great restaurants and cafe's near by. The apt looked exactly as shown in the photos. The entire place was also very clean and organized. I would highly recommend this apartment to anyone. Thank you for a wonderful stay!
714082,32940875,2019-05-30,"House is great location in queens, super close to shops and subway to Manhattan. Clean and tidy place. Entry is combination lock which makes it easy for access. As mentioned in other reviews, I was woken each night a few times due to excess noise from housemates throughout the night (and I'm a heavy sleeper!). Walls are super thin so a lot of excess noise can be heard. Other than that, the overall stay and experience was good."
533382,20583769,2021-05-23,It was okay and it’s exactly for the cheap price.. it could been better.
583096,22701969,2019-09-22,"Rebecca was an amazing host - extremely funny, thoughtful and nice. Her place is super clean and stylish, the neighborhood is beautiful and felt very safe. It’s very easy to get to Manhattan or other cool places like Williamsburg by subway or bus. We had an amazing time and fell in love with her cute dog. We’d recommend this host and place 100% and would love to stay there again next time!"
717234,33340151,2019-10-26,"Nice flat with great location near the 1-2-3 subway station. The bedroom is little but with enough storage for two. Kitchen and bathroom are shared with the host family and his cute little boy (you should expect a little noise but very bearable and only during daytime, otherwise the flat is very quiet).<br/>Michael and her wife are very friendly and can provide you lots of advice about New York! <br/>I would definitely recommand this location and we will come again!"
517454,19731225,2020-07-24,Paula’s place was perfect for me and my 3 year old. Fantastic location. Great space and the hosts were exceptional. Highly recommend.
567171,21946495,2020-07-05,Not much for the price
627782,26035350,2019-03-31,"The location is great! You can easily travel to Manhattan without getting bored with the train but all the bars and restaurants of Williamsburg are just 10 min walk away! The appartment itself was located in a quiet street so you'll get a good night sleep. Bill is a great, attentive host and his responses were quick. Great value!"
848387,47452604,2021-10-18,"Apartment was as pictured so quite nice. It’s actually in quite a nice area and the building itself is nice as well. It did clearly used to be some sort of childcare center and this is obvious in the hallway decorations and some of the items stored. But the bedroom and bathroom are as nice as advertised. The place is incredibly tidy and you are expected to do your part to keep it that way so no shoes in living space, you take out trash at end, no moving any furniture, you strip bed and put used laundry in basket. Nothing too strenuous. <br/><br/>Our only negative is that this apartment is on the ground floor and the upstairs neighbors were a little loud, running and moving furniture through the night.  You are provided a tv and a music device to play light music and drown out the noise. So this wasn’t a dealbreaker as it’s normal for apartments and accounted for. <br/><br/>Overall: great location, safe building, clean apartment, communicative host, and you really do get what you see in the images!"

824081,44631766,2021-04-14,We’ve stayed here for 5 months. It’s very quiet for the city. Very close to subway and bus stops. Convenient to shopping and great parks. The studio is very large fits 2 adults and a dog very comfortably at an affordable price!<br/>Working with The Local Stay has been really great. Their Communication and reaction has been stellar!! Definitely would stay here again.

642702,27389854,2019-06-25,I found the house very clean and the host was very nice.<br/>Helped me any time I needed. <br/>Pretty much space and quiet neighborhood!
855480,48508696,2021-11-03,"Unfortunately the apartment had not been cleaned upon checking in-there was hair and gross build up coating the bathroom and there was trash filled to the brim upon coming in the door that hadn’t been taken out. The tv did not work, the AC unit blew out a thick cloud of dust when it was turned on. The sheets and comforter smelled and appeared as though they hadn’t been washed and also had tons of hair on them. The host was responsive but completely dismissive of the condition of the apartment which resulted in me having to clean it myself and attempt to wash and dry the linens myself only to find that the washer and dryer didn’t work either. Can’t say I’d recommend the stay to anyone else."

617265,25138442,2019-12-14,"The apartment is absolutely beautiful and very close to the subway. The bed was comfortable and everything was very clean and accommodating. The only issue we had were the towels that smelled a little like mildew, but overall we enjoyed our stay. The host even offered to let us leave our luggage before check in time which was very thoughtful."
834250,46027260,2021-07-16,"We stayed two weeks in July 2021. Positives: Location location location - absolutely perfect for exploring the most interesting parts of NYC, and easy access to everywhere via the subway 1 block away. Great food nearby - so many restaurants, plus Essex Market for pre-prepped foods (shout out to Don Ceviche for the Peruvian quinoa bowl). Super clean, quiet apartment with great wifi and good lighting., and more closet space in the bedroom than I have at home! Bedroom and living room are spacious, kitchen and bathroom are more typical NYC-size. AC was essential in July and worked beautifully. I spent one week working half days at the apartment and there were no issues.<br/><br/>Negatives: As others have mentioned, the entry/stairs to the apartment can get a little dirty/smelly because of the garbage room. NYC in general doesn't manage their garbage very well so this didn't surprise me too much, but it would have been great if the space was swept/mopped more often. Thankfully, we never experienced any odors/issues inside the apartment. <br/><br/>I would recommend this space if you are looking for good value in the LES and plan to spend more time out in the city than inside the apartment!"

883754,51696057,2021-09-12,"When we first stumbled upon this apartment on AirBnB, it seemed almost too good to be true. There must be a catch! But everything was as perfect as it seemed online. The flat is on a ground floor and is VERY spacious! Very tidy and lovely place, equipped with everything you need. 2 big bedrooms, a nice bathroom, an open living room with a dining area, and a kitchen equipped with all cookwares. <br/><br/>Isis is the most thoughtful, gracious host! She is there when you need her. She is very nice and wants to share all she knows about the area. She went way beyond to make our long-weekend comfortable and memorable.  The communication was super easy and quick and the place looks exactly like it does on the pictures. The neighborhood is very conveniently located and although it’s a lively neighborhood the apartment is very quiet! We had a great stay and would absolutely recommend to stay there!

480449,17857431,2021-07-31,"Elana's house is gorgeous.  We stayed for a week and had a fabulous time.  The pictures are extremely accurate.  It is a luxurious and large two floors.  The beds were comfortable, everything was super clean, the tub in the master under the trees was magical, the lush greenery outside was beautiful to look out of every window.  The kitchen was the best stocked kitchen we have cooked in.  And the neighborhood was amazing - full of great restaurants, cafes, bars, close enough to various subway lines, lots of parks, etc.  I can't recommend it more highly."

The beds are extremely comfortable and the house is very well kept and stays quite clean. Location is great for anyone looking to stay out of the hustle and bustle of NYC, yet have easy access to the city at a moments notice. Excellent places to eat only a few blocks away, Laundry is right across the street, and the subway lines (E,F) are only a few minutes walk. This place is great!"
458579,16730833,2019-01-18,"Yves place was better then expected , it was warm , cozy , and clean. The pictures dose the home no justice. Everything  you need is close by walking distance.  He was very prompt with messages and calls  .  Very welcoming . Transportation was easy access as well .  The motion light was very essential when entering at night to see the lock pad .

The hotel is charming, the room sweet and the beds SO COMFY! <br/>The staff was attentive and always quick to respond, they went the extra mile a couple of times for us during our stay. Most especially Dovid who sprinted down the stairs when we had a small issue with our door lock. <br/>You can’t beat the location either, so close to everything. I will definitely be back to this gem again soon!"

456000,16613747,2019-10-29,"Jonathan's place was perfect for my trip! The apartment is located in a hip, young area of Brooklyn with lots of restaurants, bars and shops right in the vicinity. Visiting the city was also a breeze, Manhattan's about 15 minutes away on the L train.<br/>It was also great getting to know Jonathan a bit. He's a very worldly, interesting guy, always ready to help out. I got a lot of recommendations from him that made my trip a lot better!<br/>Finally, the apartment itself was homey, clean and comfortable. It was a great place to come back to after a long day to get some solid rest time. I basically had access to everything I could have possibly needed, Jonathan even let me borrow his hair dryer, haha! I'm also thankful for the flexibility when it came to checking in and out!<br/>This was a very positive experience and I really hope to make it back to NYC and Jonathan's place one day!"
818420,43731306,2020-07-21,"Excellent place and has everything you need. It is great for short as well as long stays. Also the apartment is in a perfect location with many attractions nearby as well as restaurants, shops, stores, parks, etc. Perfect place to enjoy the many things Manhattan has to offer :) The hosts were great and communication was very good with quick responses. My family had a great time. Definitely would stay here again. Highly recommended!!!"
141064,2151479,2021-06-20,"This was a great convenient spot for our brief NYC stay! Rhonda welcomed us at check in and gave us a detailed tour of the apartment. We didn’t spend much time in since we were out and about the whole trip, but there’s an abundance of good food and coffee spots within blocks and the subway stop was only a 10 min. walk away. The apartment had a nice hot shower, good air conditioning, and slept the 3 of us comfortably. Felt very much at home here!"

867469,49796085,2021-08-29,I had a wonderful stay in Edythe’s apartment! It’s location is amazing - close to so many restaurants and stores.  Is a quick walk to West Village and right next to the subway to get to farther locations. Her apartment has all of the essentials you would need and is cutely decorated. I would highly recommend!
841489,46712960,2021-07-05,Ricardo and Marina were wonderful hosts! Very kind and communicative. The place is clean and comfortable. There is a grocery store right opposite the apartment!

I’d definitely stay here again!"
576843,22376093,2019-11-23,"A lovely, super cozy, and nicely decorated  in East Williamsburg.

675885,29900966,2021-08-23,"Eric and Amber’s place was as described. It looked exactly like the pictures, clean and in a great location for the subway lines. The rules are simple (keep doors locked, and clean as you go). The check in / out process was very easy, the instructions were clear to follow. The few times we needed to reach Eric and Amber,  they responded within 30 minutes or less (very helpful). The AC’s were running and cooled down the apartment as needed. <br/><br/>Also - we appreciated and had fun playing (who can go down the stairs quieter) as it is an older home where the stairs creek with each step, but this only added to the character and charm of the home that we enjoyed. <br/><br/>Overall it was a great stay, and I would recommend."
666567,29153170,2019-07-12,"Great Air BnB experience. No complaints. The place is ideal for a family of four wanting to combine relaxation (on the roof terrace) with time in the city. <br/>Interesting to note that the location is probably better for getting to Manhattan than for exploring Brooklyn/Williamsburg etc (Website hidden by Airbnb) (C train gets you directly into lower, midtown or uptown Manhattan via Ralph Street station) but either way, the apartment is in a good spot. <br/>Jean is a gent... beer and water in fridge on arrival and fruit on the table plus excellent communication throughout the process. An easy 5 stars; highly recommended!"

782879,39369799,2021-03-21,"Jelena is an amazing host and her place is so tastefully decorated. We were a family of 4 (2 adults 1 little girl and 1 infant) and Jelena went above and beyond to make our stay extremely comfortable. She provided us with a high chair, snacks, crayons and little coloring books. The place was very clean and it is walking distance to a few stores and there’s a gas station behind the place where you can get a few things if you are traveling with small children (milk, juice etc). We definitely will stay there again whenever we are in NY."
625159,25838923,2019-04-19,"Комната соответствует фото , все чисто и комфортно .От метро 10 минут , несколько веток рядом , до финансового центра и бруклинского моста пол часа пешком . В целом очень удобно по адекватной цене ."

The place is exactly as pictured, super clean, and the bed was super comfy. She even left us a list of things to do around the area! Could not have asked for a better experience."
512381,19449463,2019-11-11,"I expected more than  I guess what the area generally provides with apartments in Williamsburg. ""Beautiful 1.5 bedroom in the Williamsburg area"" is in my opinion a little overstated. It is a young person's place and not quite suitable for a couple that is expecting a well decorated ""beautiful "" apartment. It needs a facelift and a women's touch to make it more functional and attractive for more affluent travelers. Unfortunately we were not able to complete our stay in the apartment and changed to a hotel after one night. <br/><br/>In all fairness to Christian, this was our first attempt at an Airbnb and probably my unrealistic expectations for the area and price range that dictated our change to a hotel."
714111,32940875,2019-10-18,"Although I didn’t see Frank that much, he seemed extremely polite and nice. The house is very modern and clean."

611921,24821651,2019-04-30,The host canceled this reservation 3 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
462739,16914748,2019-04-08,"Cat is really a superhost, the appartment is big and confy, she is always in touch for anything you may need. We were housed for almost two weeks and really felt like home. The neightbourhood is quiet and with a lot of services nearby, two subway lines in within 10 min walk, and obiously really pretty with the brownstones themselves."
865477,49565858,2021-09-12,"We absolutely loved staying at the Arlo! It was a great location and so much of a greater value than many other hotel rooms in this price point, in our opinion. We loved how new the building was, and the staff was fantastic. Would stay here again in a heartbeat."

396664,13914735,2019-08-29,l'appartamento è molto bello e confortevole. Il letto comodissimo. a 200 metri dall'oceano. L'unica nota stonata è il continuo passaggio degli aerei molto ravvicinato dato la vicinanza con il JFK. Nel complesso:top!
402063,14108870,2021-06-02,"Aleksandra was a great host and very communicative, even though she was not in the country during my stay! I felt very welcome and at home at her place."
628856,26063230,2021-08-15,"This Brooklyn apartment was great and accurate based on the description, with 4 rooms and a nice living/kitchen area. A few essentials were missing - no trash bags, not enough toilet paper, and not all rooms had air conditioning. I think this information would be helpful for future travelers. <br/><br/>The neighborhood was quiet and residential- pretty far from lively going out areas/parks. It was a nice play to come back to after the day out."
732181,34258341,2020-07-22,Javier is a great host his home very stylish and relaxing .I literally got off work shower and sleep until the next day.His family is very welcoming his mom speaks very little English but does her best to answer your questions if Javier isn’t present.The location is great right next to the subway station and Queens shopping center. Washer and Dryer & gym in the building was major.I definitely would book again !
199709,4359756,2019-09-27,"I stayed at AJ’s place as an alternative to a hotel as the UN was in town and Manhattan was in virtual lockdown and hotel prices astronomical. <br/>AJ’s apartment was 60 seconds walk from the Queensborough bridge footpath (and the subway station too) so I could even walk to work in Manhattan. There are stores and eateries on the same block so really convenient for everyday living there too. Plus having a gym on site meant I had pretty much everything I needed. <br/>The apartment was modern and really well appointed. <br/>I hardly saw AJ during the week as we keep very different hours (he’s a night owl!), but he was super friendly and always checking to see if there was anything he could do to make the stay more enjoyable. <br/>I would definitely recommend AJ’s place and he is absolutely a Super-Host."
560448,21646774,2021-09-11,a great place that I would return to any time!!
832505,45859523,2021-01-14,"The place is beautiful. Lots of space. Overall, very clean. Three things, I would like to point out. One is the house doesn’t have much heat. There was only one heater in one of the bedrooms but overall the place can get very cold. Second thing, there is only one tv in the entire home. Last thing is you can hear everything through the walls and the floor. There’s a family who lives directly under the house and you can hear them and I’m pretty sure they would be able to hear you to. So I think the rules the host has for this home was made that way for a good reason. Other than that, I would highly recommend this Airbnb home and I will definitely book again."
641854,27314650,2021-06-19,"The space was very clean and pristine, located in a nice neighborhood that is close to lively Main St. I enjoyed my stay here as it was very private and the host communicated amazingly fast when I had questions, looking forward to staying again"

636806,26842735,2021-09-17,"The location is FANTASTIC and the beds were ultra-comfortable. Fantastic after a long day of sight-seeing! True, there are many things that could use a little love and polish, especially for the price. However, if you're looking for a cozy, comfy place that will put you in the perfect position to explore NYC then Coco's place is the place to be!"

This location was really nice you can find a lot to eat in this area. Chinese food, Jamaican food,  Sea food and deli sandwiches!"
640670,27201242,2021-11-22,"The home exceeded expectations! It was so cozy and comfortable and clean, and we were totally charmed by the space. We fit 4 people in there so easily. Mansura was also an absolutely delightful host, and all steps of the check-in and check-out process were seamless! The location was about a 10-15 minute walk to the subway, which was convenient enough for the most part :)"

87752,894015,2019-06-22,"Our stay was very comfortable, homely and overall amazing. We specifically enjoyed the fact that we stayed in a residential neighbourhood with the normal household noises around us. Everything we needed was there, and then some. The fact that it was so close to the subway was also a bonus.<br/>Damon, our host was extremely friendly and helpful.<br/>If ever we travel to NY again, I would certainly like to stay at the same address again."

Brandon provided plenty of towels, k cups, pillows and soaps in the shower. It felt like home! Our flight got into NY in the morning so Brandon allowed us to drop off our bags in the morning even though check in wasn’t until later in the day. This was a huge help so we didn’t have to carry our bags around all day. Brandon was also easy to communicate with and super fast at responding to our questions."

220579,5192165,2019-02-26,"The room is in a prime location, just a little walk to public transportation. The room I was in was a little chilly when you arrive, but the heater warmed that up quickly. The comforter could use a little sprucing up,but again, Glenda was quick to address it.The kitchen is cute and Glenda provides utensils and seasoning for a nite in if you choose. Just hope you don't have visitor's that think it's ok to leave their dirty dishes in the sink.  Maybe they thought it as part of the cleaning fees,but it was annoying as they used every mug. The block is quiet. Glenda is very responsive as I missed placed one of my keys and she stayed with me until I located a spare.  Her reading collection was right up my ally. Just watch the step inside the door, it's unexpected. I would stay again. The price can't be beat."

Everything about it was wonderful. It provides what you frequently cannot find in New York, a place away from the city’s rush where you can relax with your family, cook your own meals and recharge before heading back out into the city. I highly recommend it"

Thanks again Luis and we will def see you again on one of our visits to NYC!!"

859984,49079019,2021-11-01,Very nice place!! Great area if you enjoy the night life. L train wasn’t to far if you want to head into Manhattan. Price was great!! A hotel room at this price is going to get you a room the size of a walk in closet.
189950,4077744,2019-04-28,"Great space, great location outside of the park and in the middle of all the wonderful amenities that come with Williamsburg."
352106,11575101,2021-08-19,This Airbnb was a Godsend. I was in the midst of a big move and this respite was perfect to come home to and recharge after long days of packing and shipping. I also stayed during an intense New York heatwave and this basement studio stayed cool the whole time. I cooled down in bed watching Netflix each night and grabbed coffee and a breakfast sandwich from the quaint shop right on the corner every morning. Felt safe as a single lady each night. Highly recommend and will stay again.
501354,18922939,2019-11-30,"Arielle's place is very nice, well appointed, much more stylish than your average air bnb.  Arielle is super responsive. It was an awesome experience."
343106,10939710,2019-09-26,"We had a comfortable stay with Alex and Mariana who are just radiating creativity in their loft apartment! The shared bath was clean and comfortable. The private bedroom was cozy for two and we never had a problem sharing the space with them. You will hear the train passing slightly, and if you are okay with a 30-40 min train ride to midtown, this is your place to be."
370287,12806940,2019-08-26,Larry’s Place was exactly as presented and beautifully situated in Brooklyn! Very hospitable in accommodating an early checkin due to flight change! Would definitely stay here again!

818711,43744716,2021-08-15,"The unit was at a great location. It's in a quite neighborhood away from the noise of businesses, but also in walking distance of restaurants, stores, a 24 hour CVS and a train station. Checking in and out was simple and easy, however getting up and down the steep stairs was quite challenging with our luggage. The unit was pretty spacious for NY. Both the bedrooms had A/Cs but the living room didn't and it got swelteringly hot in there during summer. The biggest problem we experienced during our stay was the bugs. There were fruit flies, cockroaches and spiders in the unit that ended up on the bed and made our stay unpleasant. Full disclosure: I did not let the host know about the bug problem during our stay as I did not want anyone else entering the unit while we were there. However, everything else was pretty great."
813433,43012924,2020-11-30,"Great space! Ended up extending our stay by a whole month and Ramiro was the best with us figuring it out. COVID times are weird, but so lucky to have found this spot to reconfigure! Couldn’t recommend it more"

La literie est niquel, tout est mis à disposition pour passer un bon séjour (4 serviettes, tongues, gel douche, shampoing et même après shampoing). Belle télé avec Netflix ! Dans la cuisine il y a tout pour faire à manger comme à la maison. Le métro est vraiment juste à côté, même pas 1 minutes de marche !! Apparemment situé au rdc donc top ! Je recommande pour le prix, excellent !"
788303,39870438,2020-01-10,Francesco is so sweet and super caring! I loved his place so much- it look exactly like the pictures. I felt so comfortable and I can’t wait to book this room again! It’s a great commute to Manhattan as well. Book this room!!! You won’t regret it!

743367,35222567,2019-08-25,"Gladwyn, I just want to say you were AMAZING!! This was my first time staying in an Airbnb. You were so accommodating to me and my best friend. Thank you for staying longer to wait for our late arrival after traveling through so many storms to get there. You were so quick to respond and so caring. You reminded us to take our time and drive safely. Once we got there you welcomed us with warm hugs and such a lovely smile. Your home is beautiful and I want to say thank you for sharing it with us. That night after being on the road so long you offered us wonderful food and conversation. It was also great meeting your son. The entire stay I felt at home and I could feel how genuinely sweet you were. I can’t thank you enough for such a great stay.  Next time we come to Brooklyn we will be staying with you!! I can’t wait to cross paths again in the future. Many blessing to you and your family!!"

438498,15817291,2019-12-01,"The place was great. Mark and Will were very nice and even more detailed. We knew exactly what to expect from check in to check out. We had info for emergencies and points of interest. We loved the room; it was cozy and clean.  it was very close to our family, but it's also easy to travel, via rideshare services or public transportation, to tourist spots in the city. This will be a favorite spot for sure."

782458,39331263,2019-12-08,"Ample street parking and spacious apartment. However, the apartment could have been cleaner, does not seem like the “cleaning fee” actually goes into cleaning the house. I’m not sure if this is common for air bnb’s , (as I have stayed in a few in major cities and have never had this issue) but the apartment was very “lived in”.  The laundry basket was full of dirty clothes, the jacket rack upon entry was full of the owners jackets and clothing, the fridge had odor with old take out containers and many open items. The shower actually had a used loofa in it... the living room floor had a large amount of wax dried all over it from candles that were nearby. The wax was also on the living room couch and the only throw blanket in the house ...... gross. There were dust bunnies everywhere, especially the guest bedroom in which we stayed due to the dirty laundry and very lived in main bedroom. The walls, also especially in the guest bedroom, had cobwebs. We were very thankful to be out of the apartment for most of the time due to the horrible smells from surrounding floors and cleanliness. The amount of space was nice in addition to the free street parking and quick walk to the subway. The check in and out process was easy via a lockbox."

My partners son stayed with us and we were all very comfortable for our four night stay. There are some great added touches- snacks and water were provided. AC in each room was also a plus! It's always nice having a kitchen which you don't get at hotels. Also, loved the bathroom. Very close to Kings Highway subway which goes into the city. Took us only 20-30min via express. The entire place was sparkling clean! Will be renting from them again should we ever come back to Brooklyn.<br/>Thanks Will and Kim!!"

Die Unterkunft bietet eine perfekte Lage für einen New York Trip. Wir waren 1 Woche vor Ort und konnten super schnell nach Manhattan fahren (ca. 20min). Mehrere Supermärkte, Cafés und Restaurants sind in wenigen Minuten zu erreichen (wir empfehlen Stonefruit Espresso+Kitchen). Mary hat uns einen leckeren Kuchen gebacken und das Zimmer war perfekt von der Größe. Wir würden jederzeit wiederkommen! Vielen Dank für die schöne Zeit! Liebe Grüße, André&Denise"

845062,47156759,2021-04-23,"Michaela’s place is great. The Airbnb is a duplex. She had everything we needed as we escaped our place while we were going through home renovations. Her oven broke during our 3 month stay, and she had it replaced IMMEDIATELY. We had access to 2 bedrooms. The house had plenty of space. She allowed for our fur babies to join us in our stay, which was extremely helpful. I would definitely recommend staying at Michaela’s home."

670949,29550259,2020-02-21,Excellent stay!<br/>John is an attentive host and the accommodation is as advertised.  The room is a bit small but not annoying. Thanks!
622570,25571627,2020-07-12,"Nice place. Spacious with thoughtful amenities as our host provided breakfast and common cooking supplies. We had a great time. However, finding street parking was difficult in such a popular area."
761799,37093438,2021-09-21,"Place was decent but definitely needs to be renovated. I would say the best part of the apartment is the shower. Easy check in, Eva provided the instructions before we got there. Perfect location, pretty close to everything. Eva answered my questions quickly. Kitchen has everything you need if you are looking to cook. The only thing that was annoying was the wifi was slow and would cut in and out, I had messaged Eva and she had offered someone to come by and look at it but I wasn’t in the apartment that much so I left it alone. If you are looking for a decent place to stay then definitely book. Eva was wonderful as well!"
811665,42780193,2021-04-17,Happy to stay again during my next visit in the Bronx!
260821,7024138,2020-10-18,It was a nice location and convenient to where we needed to be. However I did not care that his neighbors were questioning the other guest that way staying in his place. He did not provide her name or description of what she would look like. They had her standing outside for 15mins while past 10:00pm at night.

Didn't need to do any laundry on this trip, but having access to a washer and dryer can be such a lifesaver when traveling for work, and the bedroom area was so dark and quiet. Would certainly stay again!"
539643,20819020,2019-04-06,"Carla and Kalel's place was a steal. It was in an ideal location for my purposes (close to the university I was visiting), had good amenities and a clean bathroom/bedroom, and was in a generally safe neighborhood. All for an affordable price. The best part of my stay was how considerate Carla and Kalel were. My flight was delayed nearly 6 hours and I arrived to the apartment early in the morning (around 2 am) and Carla woke up and gave me some nuts and fruits when she heard that I hadn't had a chance to eat dinner. In addition, there were water bottles provided along with towels laid out on my bed. <br/><br/>The only real downside is the walk up the stairs, particularly if you have a lot of luggage. It's 5 flights of stairs - but I guess you could see this as a chance to workout.<br/><br/>If you need to be close to Morningside Heights, Harlem, or Upper Manhattan, this apartment listing is a great value."

The flat is very close to metro and supermarkets (on the way to metro). So it is very easy and close to go from here to Manhattan center. The kitchen is well equipped for having breakfast and cooking in the evening. The beds are very comfortable and all was very clean and exactly like it was mentioned on AirBnB. We really enjoyed our stay and we would highly recommend Mohammed’s flat. If we come back to New York, we would definitely stay here again. <br/><br/>Big thanks to Zain and Mohammed for your support and your hospitality. <br/><br/>Janine and family"

106839,1223230,2019-03-07,"If you ever wondered what it was like to stay in a bohemian Tribeca loft, this is it. I came for business and it was a very easy time. There’s a little bit of a maze run to find the space in the building, but nothing that’s an issue. Jackie is a very accommodating and thoughtful host."

2156,8490,2019-11-29,"This is the first time that my  husband  and I traveled  to Brooklyn/NY with our children, who  are  17, 15  and 12. We loved  staying  here. It was perfect for us and really gave a taste of what it might be  like to live in NY. I love old homes and this one had beautiful architectural detail. Nathalie was extremely responsive. The neighborhood was wonderful and we felt like we were home. Wish we could have stayed longer, but we will definitely be back to visit again."
741172,35085826,2019-06-14,"The hospitality was stupendous. Geralde was beyond generous, her place was cozy and clean with all hygiene necessities included.

572867,22208373,2019-10-08,"Spent 1 month here and had a pretty good experience. Check in was fine, but there are a few *minor* issues with the apartment upon arrival: microwave door handle was partially off, one of the blinds was broken, the ROKU barely works, internet went out the last two days of my stay there, and the building/unit had a bug issue my last two nights... but overall, it’s a good studio apartment in a fantastic area close to everything. Corporate apartment quickly responded and remedied everything so Im giving them 5 stars. Only other things to call out for those who haven’t spent time in NYC before: You have to walk up three flights of stairs due to no elevator, and the trash take out is a little wonky... but again these are very minor issues and if I was in a pinch, and needed another long term stay I’d use the unit again. (Just fix the little minor issues and use a higher quality cleaning crew for the $150 fee, and I think the place would be perfect.)"
376878,13139462,2019-05-31,"Lorraine was able to accommodate my need for a quick stay on an incredibly short notice; within an hour, I was able to get to her place and check in immediately. The small space was impeccably clean and had lovely resources and charm."

Irene was kind enough to leave some foods out for us, which we greatly appreciated during rushes breakfasts! She also accommodated our bags for a few hours so that the kids had time to check out “hippopotamus park” before catching our train to the next destination. I would highly recommend!"

701040,31881052,2021-05-25,Solid place for a short stay and even better for location. Only thing missing was some basic utensils like knives and forks and the toaster didn’t work and neither did the stove. Otherwise the place is clean and we enjoyed the great smells!
481935,17980714,2019-04-08,Nancy was a gracious host and super helpful. She even supplied extra toiletries because the airline had lost my luggage.

580486,22485639,2021-06-11,DO NOT STAY HERE. The filthiest apartment I have ever seen… mortifying. They had rats in the apartment that caressed my 70 year old father within hours of arrival. Host promised a full refund but days later blackmailed and threatened me in exchange for a good review. Never received a refund from the host.
877349,50907781,2021-09-14,"Jose’s place is exactly as advertised. It’s incredibly clean and airy, especially for an NYC apt. Jose and Luz were quick to respond when we had questions.  The apt is set up perfectly for an air bnb-enough dishes and space to feel comfy but without all the nick nacks and chotskies that some other places have.  There were 5 of us staying here. We were out and about all day so it didn’t ever get to the point of feeling crowded or anything.  The a/c works great and the shower was very fancy. Kitchen has a coffee maker and huge fridge. Grocery store is right across the street. Takes about 45 to get to/from Manhattan via subway but it is very convenient as the train is literally a minute walk from the front door. If you are a light sleeper you might be kept up by the sound, but it’s kind of like white noise. <br/><br/>All in all, I HIGHLY recommend staying at Jose’s!"
78274,784124,2020-01-02,"Nice place, location could be better, a bit steep of a price"

The apartment is located in the ground floor.<br/><br/>The apartment was quite clean.  I got everything which I required from clothing iron - ironing table to most of the necessary things in kitchen like water electric kettle, microwave, rice cooker etc...<br/><br/>Further more the house is just 5 min walk to the nearest underground ""149th Street–Grand Concours  station"" with connection to both red and green lines of Manhattan, and takes just 2 stops (10min) to reach Manhattan.<br/><br/>Last but not the least, apartment is also 10 mins walk to nearest supermarket.<br/><br/>So in short I definitely recommend Desmar apartment for staying."

She had great recommendations for activities I was keen on and was just a welcoming host. Kimberly’s place is in a great spot that made access to greater Williamsburg and Manhattan a breeze—everything was a quick walk or straightforward ride away.

851779,47977156,2021-11-29,"Grace has a very nice home and she’s responsive when needed. Her property manager is also helpful and quick to respond. The neighborhood is quiet and peaceful and close to the beautiful Amersfort Park. It may seem really deep in Brooklyn, but we were able to Uber to Midtown Manhattan in less than an hour on Sunday. <br/><br/>The house itself is two floors and has three comfortable bedrooms and has one bathroom on each floor. The kitchen and dining area is more spacious than the photos make it look four can comfortably eat at the table, and two more at the kitchen island.<br/>There is an eclectic collection of furniture so there’s plenty of seating.<br/><br/>This is a great escape from the city if you’re a NY local or if you’re coming to NYC but looking for a less frenetic pace and more space. Be sure to check out the historic Reformed church a few minutes walk away!"

489395,18358606,2019-06-16,"The place is exactly as depicted in the pictures. It is a bit squishy with max. number of occupants but that's NY. VERY close to the subway (literally like 20 seconds away) and a short walk to central park! Kate was very accommodating/patient for our late flight in. Unfortunately, there was a single key fob between 6 people and only two toilet rolls for 5 nights. Otherwise, great location and Netflix was a plus !"

661999,28817364,2019-09-17,"Great location, close to subway station in to all things NYC. Our only complaints were being unable to flush toilet paper in the washrooms (that smelt awful for some reason), one towel per person and no option for early or late check ins with flights."

There was sufficient space for two people, it was perfectly located to get around Chelsea and other neighborhoods like Greenwich village, as well as convenient for trains headed to Brooklyn or Upper Manhattan. There was no disruptive noise at night, and check in/out was a breeze. I would absolutely stay here again. I'm not sure you could find a similar value nearby for the price."

658274,28500619,2019-09-19,"We recently spent a week in Anthony’s Brooklyn apartment. The position is fantastic being close to parklands, countless good eateries ,retail shops and subway transport ( Bedford Avenue). You can’t beat it for location. <br/>The apartment itself is average. The apartment is three floors upstairs so please bear this in mind. The layout of the unit could be described as a large bachelor pad with one main bedroom and two very small single bedrooms. The kitchen and dining areas are compact for a maximum of four people. There were several maintenance issues that needed  addressing  such as broken air conditioner , dishwasher , toilet door and window. But given these minor issues , you are in a fantastic location surrounded by so many wonderful experiences."

My cousin and I stayed during the time of my churches Music Conference, which was conveniently located near my church and in a great neighborhood.<br/>Naftaly was always prompt and always provided info leading up to our stay and throughout our stay, to help make sure everything was smooth and just right for us. This is certainly a place I'd love to stay at again and certainly recommend for those wanting a nice quiet place, that's not far way and very close to the transit."
323581,9826628,2019-05-19,Nice clean room. Fast response time to certain questions such as places to eat. I would stay there again.
699569,31715312,2021-07-05,"We should have listened when we saw another review saying the blankets were dirty, because they were FILTHY, covered in hair, shoe prints and ...unknown fluids. Every single bed was like this. We had to go buy our own sheets at a target nearby. <br/>I had to scrub and sanitize the shower before use because there was mold in it, and clearly a plumbing issue because the water was choppy and made a constant loud noise every time you turn it on. <br/>Floor was extremely dirty and had black feet after walking on it. We even opened the microwave and there was still a half-eaten pizza in it! I have pictures of it all. Giving 2 stars because the lobby man was very kind, and this place is very close to Empire State, Times Square, and we still made the best of our time in New York."
757100,36601571,2021-09-05,"Great place. Amazing neighborhood. Very pretty rooms combining the old exposed brick with the vivid room colors and bathroom tile. Small rooms, as to be expected in Nolita, but very charming."
455279,16577736,2019-04-27,"I really enjoyed my stay in this sweet townhouse, my new home away from home. I had a lovely bedroom with an adjoining small room that could serve as an office, but it was also just a nice desk to sit and drink tea, looking out the window at the beautiful old church across the street. It was so cozy under the just-right quilt that I was more inspired to read, but there was a smart television available. My room was supplied with bathrobe & towels, a shower with plenty of hot water in the bathroom down the hall, and there were enough mirrors to check my clothes choices. I also appreciated that a door from my room led directly to the street when I wanted to make a quick get away, or if the weather had changed, and I needed to come back up for one more thing. <br/><br/>Jonathan and David were perfect hosts, greeting me on my way through the living room to the kitchen which was available for coffee and whatever leftovers I brought home. There was even a wooden table and chairs to sit on in the small backyard. Leaves were coming out, and flowers were blooming in late April, and I am sure it just gets even more beautiful and shaded in the summer. David was the horticulturalist, and plants were well-tended, adding color everywhere. Our hosts were always ready to answer any questions I had about getting around, and I was thrilled to take a few rides on the new Astoria ferry. <br/><br/>I am an English professor with a specialty in film adaptations. One morning over coffee, Jonathan and I had a fascinating discussion about life, art, and films. This conversation helped me rediscover the feeling of belonging that I wanted when I came back to visit my hometown of New York City. Jonathan and David created a friendly atmosphere that made me feel right at home in Queens even though most of my time away was spent in Manhattan. From this location, it is an easy 15-minute walk to the 30th Ave subway. The neighborhood feels safe, with grocery stores open at night and people out walking. It is also convenient to La Guardia Airport by yellow cab, public transit, and ride-hailing services. Astoria has so much to offer, and I hope to do more exploring when I return. <br/><br/>This place was my first AirBnB ever, and I feel so lucky that I found it!"
778421,38837553,2019-11-02,"Nice size room; comfortable bed; large dresser and small closet; and a big smart TV. Pretty solid. (Clean bathroom, as well.)<br/>But the best part is Nehi being quite accommodating and attentive; his housemates are very nice, as well.<br/>Highly recommended."

The space is perfect for 2 people to stay. The location of the Airbnb is excellent, right around the corner is the 6 train but there's also so many local coffee shops and restaurants within 5 minute walking distance.  Overall, I just want to thank Laura for being such a great host and amazing person. I stayed here for my birthday week and she left a birthday message and some chocolates for me. She was very responsive to any questions I had and she always checked in to make sure everything was going okay. I will definitely come back to New York just to stay at Laura's place!"
862188,49291302,2021-10-23,"Smack in the middle of the Williamsburg action, this flat was wonderful for us. We loved exploring the neighborhood, eating all the food, and popping into an endless supply of cute vintage shops. We will definitely return!"

Today when I was inadvertently picking up my luggage, my dog ​​left the building, I had left the doors open and when I left the bathroom my dog ​​was not there. You can imagine .. !! I went to ANIMAL Care & Control of NYC. I started looking for my dog ​​everywhere and Mrs. Yolanda at all times supporting and helping me to locate the dog, walking through the streets. In fact, she was the one who found him at a neighbor's house ..! God bless you always, Mrs. Yolanda. Pd: When they offer you a service that goes beyond an economic agreement for a lodging and you feel that feeling of human warmth, for me it is worth more than what you pay for the stay. RECOMMENDED 100%."

485660,18117334,2020-02-18,I had an amazing time. I had to leave early due to an emergency and Amaya was super kind. Her space is beautiful and clean and in such a great location in Bushwick!

879047,51052642,2021-09-08,The room was clean and exactly as described. Excellent location and Fernando was really helpful Also the concierge staff. The only suggestion is to add a curtain in the window for the light sleepers ( not allowing light to come in while sleeping) otherwise super!

275876,7837816,2019-04-09,"El lugar es justo como en las fotos.  La cama muy cómoda, cuenta con calefacción por lo que no pasamos frío. El baño es compartido pero no tuvimos ningún problema con eso. Todo limpio. Edgar respondió rápido a todas nuestras preguntas. Todo muy fácil a la llegada y salida.  El departamento está en Brooklyn un poco lejos de las atracciones turísticas pero esta muy bien comunicado cerca de metro y autobús.  El barrio tranquilo. Regresamos casi todos los días después de media noche y no vimos nada extraño. Un buen lugar para hospedarse"

862668,49368511,2021-06-06,"Fantastic location and great facilities, staff was helpful in moving in etc. However the room is not very clean, dusty etc. Common areas are great which means many people use it, but also means it’s filthy as well. New stains can be seen every other day on the tables and chairs and seems like no one cleans it."
742699,35183293,2021-06-16,"A very nice stay, once again. Consistently clean, neat, and well-appointed."

561202,21714930,2019-10-14,This house was a great spot for my friends and I who were visiting NYC for the weekend.
443069,16026567,2019-03-10,"Sam's place is extremely good value in a really nice area. The room is exactly as described and perfectly comfortable. Sam and Nikki are very helpful, easy going  and friendly, but also not at all intrusive. The 2 huge fluffy cats are totally gorgeous and are a real touch of homeliness for cat lovers! My only comment would be that the old heating system chugs away and it was at times boiling and I had to sleep with window wide open ( even at -6 degrees outside) But I'm probably at that heat sensitive stage of my life!!!<br/>Really good transport links into Manhattan with the L train, though at present this is not working at the w/e and has bus replacement, which was more challenging! I even found a ferry route on one of my journeys, which was fun. As anywhere, you're just getting the hang of everything, when you have to leave. Highly recommend Champ's Diner just up the street, delicious Vegan food ( even for a non-vegan) in a cool retro café with friendly staff. Also, Café Mogador in North Williamsburg ( Moroccan/Med) was great and obviously popular as there were queues for tables. I'm a keen photographer so the highlights for me were the East River Park for fantastic views over to Manhattan and the area between Manhattan and Brooklyn bridges (get subway to York St) so iconic."
35049,215560,2021-08-28,"The check in was pretty normal, our room was at 3rd floor (two girls with heavy suitcases but whatever). The apartment had not very good cat’s smell, probably because of the 2 cats that was actually really friendly but my friend is afraid of cats so after we told Mary about it we burly saw them. Also the smell got better the day after we came. We didn’t know about the fact that we need to share the bathroom with one more room. Also the water drain was partially blocked or something so the water didn’t drain well. The room was big and had a lot of space for our staff. The air conditioner was very bad, we got sweaty at night but Mary said she is going to buy a new one. We ask if we can use the laundry machine and Mary said that it will cost us 15 dollars. Outside laundry places price is 5 dollars. The amount we paid on the apartment was high enough so it was upsetting. Generally the experience was 2 out of 5."
158242,2896760,2021-10-17,"I enjoyed my stay at Angelo's place. It was clean and cozy, and he was very kind. The only thing is that door to bathroom is a bit hard to close/open. Overall totally recommended"

148038,2451110,2019-04-28,Roses place was just what we needed! Plenty of space for 3. Great location and quiet building! Will definitely return!
767474,37598410,2019-11-01,"What a perfect place! We didn’t get to meet Rita but we met her husband Aliou who is absolutely amazing! He welcomed us, helped me up the stairs with my heavy bag and proceeded to give me all the tips about NYC and the Harlem neighborhood which was super helpful coz i had nothing planned :S. During our whole stay he continued to stay in touch and made us feel very at home, he even tried to communicate with my mom who doesn’t speak any english to make her feel welcome and he definitely did. Now the location is pretty conveniently located in the same block as a laundry spot, a convenience store and a bank, oh and a few small restaurants, also it is a 12 min walk to the Red Rooster and Sylvias which are staples for Harlem food, along with the Shrine for live african roots music and the Apollo theater! Oh and the famous Harlem brownstones are right around the corner plus only a couple of blocks to the A, C, 2 and 3 subways which take you to Times square in 20mins and all the way to lower manhattan in less than 40mins. Oh when you go to explore Lower manhattan please cross the Brooklyn bridge into Brooklyn and go to The front pizza, their stuff is super delicious and apparently Al Pacino shoot a movie there and loves their pizza. Also a great spot for pizza in lower manhattan is Rosella’s and if at any point you need a massage go to Chelsea Body work in chinatown: best 1 hr Swedish massage I have ever had for only $40. Overall staying at Aliou and Rita’s made a huge impact in our experience in NYC so I absolutely recommend this spot! Please do yourself a favor and pick them!"

Joy is an amazing and accommodating host she was very attentive and responsive to all my questions. I highly recommend this apartment and Joy as a host if you’re looking for an apartment thats close to the lively neighborhood of Bushwick and a 25 minute train from Manhattan. I honestly couldn’t have asked for more in my long stay."

601931,24033132,2021-10-24,"Oh my goodness, this apartment couldn’t have been any cleaner, brighter or more comfortable! The courtyard was charming and great for a bit of fresh air. The kitchen has everything you need for a few days or a few weeks. The shower is amazing and the bed is so seriously snuggly and comfortable that we didn’t want to get up. It was only a block away from my son and daughter-in-law so convenience was a top priority. Sandy was a very responsive host who thought of everything to my our stay so perfect. I’ll be definitely staying the next time I visit Brooklyn again."

751387,35907014,2021-05-25,"Pretty good place. Lobby is beautifully decorated. The hallways to your hotel room are a little dark and narrow, but fine. The room is nicely lit by natural light during the day and mornings. <br/><br/>A little of an odd layout with the bathtub (which is massive), shower, and sink in the open with no wall, while the toilet is in its own closed off room with just a trash can. You can see it in the pictures a little, but odd to navigate once you're there. Perfectly fine if its you and a significant other just be sure to close the curtains if either of you are going to shower/bath. <br/><br/>Only complaint would be the bathrobes are not comfortable. They don't seem to use fabric softener to keep the inner lining of the robe soft. <br/><br/>Also the rooftop doesn't seem to be open for some reason when I went. Hopefully it will open up in the future. There is a tall building nearby with a great rooftop lounge called cloudM which I recommend for sunset views!"

883631,51687864,2021-09-26,"Great studio (yes, this is a studio so it’s VERY cozy for 2 people - like a college dorm cozy) located close to transportation and great restaurants. <br/><br/>Besides an initial hiccup at check in with the cards not working, Idan and crew figured it out. <br/><br/>The rest was great, clean unit. Them holding the bags for you after checkout is appreciated. <br/><br/>Oh, and check out is prompt at 11am. <br/><br/>I was about to open door right at 11 when cleaning lady swung it right open without warning so be very punctual."
709021,32611977,2019-05-06,"Not much else can be said about Arnol and his home that hasn’t already been said! My now Fiancée and I (I proposed in Central Park during our trip!) visited New York for 5 days. The first Air BNB we stayed in cancelled one day of our reservation so I scrambled to find a replacement. Now I wish Arnol’s home was available for the entire trip! Before booking his communication was great, and through our one-day stay he was beyond great. We were greeted by sparkling clean home that smelled great and offered coffee immediately which we of course accepted as it had been raining. When we asked about local eateries, Arnol gave suggestions but insisted on us letting him make breakfast. We didn’t want to be an imposition but he told us cooking was his passion so we accepted. Best food by far! It truly felt as if we were visited a family member and would definitely stay again!"

140693,2137796,2019-12-07,"So I've stayed in a number of really good Airbnb locations with Super Host ratings, but Richelle & Pela take the bakery not just the cake and this is not just for the sparkling clean, nice homely apartment, but for their sheer humanity and genuine warmth. <br/><br/>I had been flying for 26hrs and had a frustrating encounter with my prior reservation and Richelle said yes to every extra I asked for, and arriving to meet Pela who is  simply a gentleman's gentleman, had a calming effect on my nerves.<br/><br/>The space for me was more than sufficient for my needs, and has everything you need for a small family. It was cozy and the street was quiet at night which is important for me as a light sleeper. Richelle and Pela did not leave the fridge empty or the bathrooms without the neccesities, and all  they provided came with a little extra, or a personal touch.<br/><br/>beware of the stairs though, that said I'd take the apartment anyday I'm in NYC over alot of places I've stayed in Manhattan.<br/><br/>I ubered all through my stay and never got to figure out how close we were to the Public Transport facilities near the apartment but I was minutes away from any malls and financial centres I needed to find.<br/><br/>I'm  looking forward to my next trip to NYC already and it'll be a bummer If I'm unable to get my days on their calendar.<br/><br/>Excellent Choice."
73995,739242,2021-05-31,"The apartment on the 4th floor is a snug 1BR.  To host more people is more than a tight squeeze - but I supposed living in the UWS people would expect nothing less.  The amenities in the apartment are very nice, and during my stay the place was very clean.  The noise and the grime in the area (streets and sidewalks) was a bit disheartening, and speaks probably to poor city management and a lack of concern by the neighborhood and citizenry.  Nevertheless, it affects the ""feel"" of the stay there.  As an example, the amount of dog poo on the sidewalks was insane.  <br/><br/>Izi has a team that helps maintain the building - they are incredibly helpful, courteous, and respectful.  <br/><br/>I stayed at Izi's apartment for 3 months and had virtually no issues.  Like I said, the amenities in the apartment were great, and I had no problems whatsoever."
871703,50211821,2021-10-01,"This apartment is actually a timeshare. The owners are allowed one of a number of apartments, so the one you get may not be the one pictured. We had an inside room with no view. <br/>The room was immaculate and the staff was absolutely wonderful.<br/>Unfortunately, there was an issue with mold in both bathrooms. <br/>The location is the best part. This site is right around the corner from the Russian tea room, near the subway and a short walk to Columbus Circle."
684840,30441211,2020-12-27,"Lance is a great and thoughtful host who goes above and beyond to ensure his guests’ comfort. If you want a cozy place in the midtown area, that’s clean and owned by a friendly host, look no further."
848988,47544056,2021-11-15,"The room is very small (smaller than I expected). You are essentially just paying for a place to sleep, which is fair. It was in a good location for access to Broadway. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, it was disgusting. Despite the fact that there is a cleaning fee associated with the price (I think it was around $80), it didn't seem like the place had been cleaned at all. There was a bunch of stuff on the sheets, which was kind of gross, and the floor (in the bedroom, in the hallway, and in the bathroom) was just absolutely covered in stuff (not even sure what some of it was but also dirt, leaves, etc). There was a bunch of rust and metal shaving next to the toilet and the shower was not very clean either. There were Black Forrest gummies on the dresser, which we think were left by the last guests (they were not marked at all if they were provided by the host). We did not feel comfortable showering there or touching the ground without shoes on. I've stayed at similar places around here for about the same price and none of them were this bad. <br/><br/>The worst part was probably the smoking. The living room/kitchen area was blocked from view by a curtain. I'm pretty that there was someone besides the other guests in the apartment who used it, but the entire place smelled like someone had lit up a joint right next to you (it is possible that it was the other guests smoking pot but the smell was the strongest near the blocked off living room and bathroom). I know weed is now legal in New York, but smoking anything indoors has negative second-hand respiratory consequences. I had difficulty breathing at points because of it.<br/><br/>This is probably also on us because we never reached out to the host, but there were no tissues anywhere or a trashcan in the room."
605266,24306539,2021-06-01,"My stay was great, super easy to check-in, and the location is fantastic (short walk to the East River, parks nearby, bodegas everywhere, and a host of great cafes and restaurants without even leaving the neighborhood. The room was perfect for my short stay, and the bed was very comfortable. The apartment is up a few flights of stairs so just keep that in mind if you have a lot of luggage (or aren't good with stairs). Met Jackie briefly on my last night and had a nice chat about photography, too. Will stay again on a future visit to NYC if the room is available!"
879055,51052642,2021-11-12,Francisco is a great host!  Seamless check in and he was very responsive. His place is as advertised. Small and clean in a great location.

505001,19102027,2019-12-15,"This is a decent place to stay in the heart of Williamsburg at a reasonable price. We arrived late due to a delayed flight, but check-in via an outdoor key lockbox was easy. You get a private bedroom in a small apartment with a crowded common area. The room size and furnishings are standard-- there was nothing particularly notable. The bathroom however is very small, with a somewhat unusual arrangement in which the toilet is located a few feet from the kitchen sink (with a door in between of course). But if you're after a good location at a low price, this is a good deal.<br/><br/>The two correctable criticisms I have are: (1) the room was very hot and stuffy both nights we stayed (in mid-December), and no guidance was given as to controlling the temperature-- the instructions advise you not to open the windows, but without cracking a window it was very uncomfortable; (2) the common area and kitchen were not particularly tidy. There were dirty dishes in the sink most of the time we were there.<br/><br/>One final note: we never met Aigerim, but another guy (co-host?) was in the apartment for most of our stay, using the common room as a workspace/lounge area."
563013,21785354,2019-10-05,Mary was a friendly host and the room was very comfortable. Communication was excellent with very clear directions. I highly recommend!

576873,22376093,2021-06-16,"Aracelis’s place was the perfect place to stay for my first time in New York. The neighborhood was pretty quiet and located close to a lot. There was a park nearby, a few restaurants, and even subway stations nearby. The price I paid was great compared to a hotel and it allowed for that extra cozy feeling also. My friends loved the place also and it felt roomy enough for us also. Having laundry available was very nice because I definitely didn’t feel like doing laundry when I got back to California, so that helped out a lot also."

652210,28049432,2020-03-02,"Very disappointed for a Superhost. Not enough toilet paper - as guests who is traveling with a 4yr old, requesting items from a superhost isn't a priority.  Not enough towels and sheets.  No keys in lockbox while in 27degree weather... again, with a 4yr old! Your instructions never mention anything about charging for early checkin ---- it's a common courtesy for a Superhost!!! But, nope,  just plain greed.  Then,  after having to agree to payment,  the keys weren't even in the lockbox.... in 27degree weather with a 4yr old! The reason you didn't secure payment is because access wasn't granted early, period.  I'm sorry but this superhost was very disappointing."

764876,37260475,2021-09-02,"Martha’s Studio is neat and clean. Responded messages very quick, nearby has subways and a plaza that has a lot restaurants. The only concern is that ac is right above the bed, which is a little bit noisy while sleeping. Other than that, everything is perfect."

I’ve stayed here twice and the experience is consistently above expectation - clean modern rooms, nice bathrooms, full gym, in hotel restaurant and bar, and a coffee shop. In a central location east to get around the city via subway at Times Square and penn station. Definitely recommend. <br/><br/>Rooms are compact, but location makes it worth it."
876354,50776915,2021-10-10,"an absolute MUST stay. alyssa was very accommodating and always willing to help. the trip felt like staying over at a friends place more than it did feel like an airbnb (which i loved that she made us feel so comfortable). thomas was also a plus! he was a very sweet boy and always accepting pets. can not give enough creds to this place, it was surrounded by everything you could possibly need. definitely know where i’m staying when i come down again!"
533934,20619757,2019-04-08,Gabe was great. Was shooting a music video on the property and he was very accommodating to my director and crews needs. Even allowed us to film on his personal stoop.  Appreciate what he did for us. Clean aesthetically pleasing property. Great stay!!!!
721588,33688719,2019-06-03,Robert’s apartment was absolutely wonderful ! Check in was so easy and he answered all my questions. It’s a perfect cozy spot and we loved it. Very close to the subway. We would definitely stay here again !
644877,27528267,2019-10-26,"Parfaitement conforme à la description, le logement est bien équipé, le lit est très très confortable. Il y a une salle de bain personnelle avec une machine à laver si besoin, des serviettes en quantités. La chambre est très bien, un service à café très utile au réveil ;-) avec une machine à capsule, et une bouilloire pour se faire un café instantané (très pratique, nous avons opté pour ce mode). Le logement est proche de tous commerces, de bonnes affaires à faire sur Gates Avenue. Le Bus passe juste à côté (utilisable avec la MétroCard) et le Métro ""Gates"" à 10 mn à pied. De Gates, nous étions à 30mn de Times Square (ligne J/Z puis N à ""Canal""). Le point vraiment intéressant c'est l'autonomie d'accès au logement, on y accède avec un code sur un clavier. Nous pouvions partir tôt, rentrer très tard... ça ne posait aucuns problèmes... Tous les avantages de l'hôtel sans les inconvénients... Rashmi et sa femme sont très sympathiques, même si nous les avons finalement peu croisés, nous avons eu l'occasion d'échanger quelquefois avec eux et nous avons trouvé 2 personnes de confiance qui prennent soin de leurs hôtes... Je recommande"

847865,47406799,2021-10-06,"A great place to crash on Staten Island. Safe and comfortable location, ample parking, quick access to beach boardwalk with beautiful views, nearby bus stop for easy travel, quiet neighborhood.<br/><br/>The unit itself was roomy for a studio. The bed was cozy, the couch comfy to work from, and the kitchen a pleasure to cook in. Everything was very clean and easy to navigate, including check in. Daniel was great and very easy to reach when needed but didn't interfere in the stay. He was immensely helpful one late night when I thought I locked myself out and panicked thinking it was too late to get any help. He replied right away with a quick solution and my night was able to resume as planned. He's thought of everything! I would definitely stay here again as it made visiting family a breeze."
753700,36198348,2019-10-19,Pros<br/>Location is close enough to subway.<br/>Super easy check in<br/>Kitchen was clean<br/>Very quiet neighborhoods. <br/>Laundry is 2-3mins from the studio.<br/><br/>Cons<br/>WiFi worked but slow.<br/>No dining table<br/>Sound insulation wasn’t good enough.

506978,19192149,2019-09-24,"The location is just great, within a block from Morningside Park, 2 blocks from subway line C, 10 minutes walk from Columbia University. The room is easily accessible thanks to the elevator. The apartment and the room are sparkling clean and comfy. Note that the kitchen is off limits, but we didn't need it. On the other side, the host provided an amazing choice of free snacks, water, and even a bottle of excellent Pinot Noir wine in our room. This is what I call ""going above and beyond""! Also the host lent us their Met membership card - and remember that Met in within a walking distance (about 40 min through the Central Park - a very pleasant walk!). So we saved $50 just by using this card to pay a visit to Met! All in all, staying with Jen and Paul was an extremely pleasant experience. Next time we go to New York we hope to stay with them again."

368156,12645495,2019-04-22,"The host is absolutely the gem of this AirBnB she’s quick to respond with any questions, suggestions, and concerns. She goes above and beyond what you would expect and treats you like family. The place is very clean and we were given a pack of goodies from the beginning to welcome to the place. The beds are nice, Netflix in the living room, and the place is very clean. I would highly recommend staying here with a large group of friends."

520486,19908261,2019-08-11,"Gulcin’s place was so nice! Great location, the subway is literally right downstairs so it was easy to get around. The space was very clean and fit 7 of us very nicely! There was a double bed in each bedroom (3 bedrooms), and she laid out a cot in one room to fit the last person. My favorite part was that Gulcin did different themes in each bedroom and decorated it accordingly. So cute!! She offered to give us tips and information about things to do around the Airbnb which was so thoughtful. I definitely recommend this host and apartment!"

841524,46727329,2021-09-18,Great location !!. All major tourist attractions are with in walking distance or just a few minute bus ride. Anna is very responsive. The apartment was bit tight for us but you cannot expect bigger space in NYC downtown so overall good  experience.

851876,47982995,2021-08-16,"James’ place is simply great. I was a solo traveler and the space given was perfect for me. Comfortable room, large apartment layout for NYC. WiFi was pretty good. There’s no traditional living room with a couch and tv but there was a large living area turned into a private cafe of sorts with tables and seating. I liked to work from there most days. <br/><br/>The area had a neighborhood feel to it and I always felt safe. On sort of a quiet block. It wasn’t hard to get to a bus or subway, and the street noise was low even on weekends. You will need to use subway or bus to get to most typical nyc site seeing locations as the area is only walkable to Central Park really. Plenty of restaurants and bars walkable though. <br/><br/>I spent a month there living around James and he was very accommodating and easy to get a long with. He was very considerate of me and interested in ensuring I was having a good time. We had numerous interesting conversations and even shared a couple meals together.<br/><br/>I had a wonderful experience and would sign up again in the future if I’m solo traveling again to nyc."

736687,34644152,2021-05-24,"The host was rude and disrespectful. She literally locked us out of the room twice after it was already paid for.  She doesn't have the decency to speak on the phone, only text and is inattentive to peoples need and always wants to get in the last word. I rate my experience a zero with this host..."
843433,46973548,2021-03-10,Great location. Attentive host. Comfy space.
539493,20817201,2019-05-29,"The location is great! Sam is very nice and welcoming. Fully equipped kitchen.<br/><br/>Since the room has no windows, so it might be hard to ventilate it properly, but if you are looking for a place to lay down a go out during a day, rather than to live there, the place is great.<br/><br/>Thx Sam!"

753553,36178860,2019-11-17,The place is nice; great location. Expect very poor communication; the heat went out in the morning and the owner didn’t respond to my texts until after midnight (12 hours) later.
427436,15423923,2019-12-21,"I really enjoyed my 2 week stay here. The house was very clean, plenty room, and always warm and quiet. I never really seen the other guests, only on occasion when I would go downstairs to the kitchen or to the bathroom. My room was comfortable, and had everything I needed: small desk with lamp, towel, tissue, hangers in the closet, and I loved the heater provided. (It added a real homey touch) The house is also in a very convenient location, only about 2 min walk to the train station, which was my way of travel back and forth to work. Also, numerous restaurants, pharmacies, food markets, banks, shopping stores within walking distance. Her neighborhood was safe, and I felt ok walking early morning hours, around 445, 5 am to the train station. I would definitely stay here again and recommend it! I was so nervous bc I'd never stayed in an Airbnb, but it was perfectly fine and met my expectations."

C'è una fermata metro a pochi passi e una miriade di bar e locali in cui mangiare, un market e una lavanderia automatica. Joe è un host fantastico, amichevole e disponibile a qualsiasi richiesta. Un discorso a parte è l'organizzazione generale dell'appartamento che anche se piccolo è  funzionale, ma troppo pieno di roba, e per la pulizia che, non ostante Joe ne provveda ogni giorno, non è molto accurata.."

The bathroom is shared and was kept clean throughout the day. I really didn’t come out of the room much because I work long remote hours. However when I did see Mishelly in passing she made sure I was ok. Like asking how well I slept and and even let me borrow a mouse to work with when I’d forgotten mine. The bed was so comfy I don’t remember waking up in the middle of the night. If I had to add anything it’d probably be a fan in the room."

(The host said she is not providing shampoos for every each race.) - not like it described on Airbnb.<br/>The living room with TV was not for sharing. (The host said it is her private area.) - not like as described.<br/>There was 2 fans as described but could not plug in since the cord was too short and no available plug-in spot. <br/>No visitors are allowed which is not described on house rules.<br/>The room has three table lights and it was not bright enough for me.<br/>No microwave. (The host said she does not believe microwave.)<br/>The host is using her living room as her bedroom without any partition and the kitchen is right next to the living room. <br/>The host said I am using a lot of water but she is not for the next generation.<br/>The atmosphere reminded me of my grandmother's place. <br/>No extra bed linens for the whole month.
774949,38469091,2021-09-11,"Great stay, great host. The place felt just like home. The host made a great use of the space. Everything was clean and the bathroom had extra toothbrushes (I forgot mine at home). This is my new go to place."
864839,49462031,2021-11-02,"Nice location and clean room. The space is like a hotel with a common kitchen on the floor. There are about 15-17 rooms with 1/2 rooms having private bath (this being one of them) and the others sharing 3 baths on the floor. Having private bath was really good. The rooms are cleaned every week with fresh linen and towels provided. The housekeeping staff is nice and polite! The only point is regarding the kitchen. It's hard to do much serious cooking there. Some of the appliances didn't work properly (kettle didn't work and toaster worked on one side). The kitchen is also shared with a lot of people so you have to be aware of that. Most people used their own utensils which they carried from their rooms every time they wanted to cook something. This was not a problem for me since I didn't really cook much but if you're planning to cook a lot then just be aware of this. Other than that, I felt other tenants sharing the space were super courteous (and clean!) as well. Mostly students on exchange programs. I really loved the location of this place. Can't ask for better! Super close to Riverside park and walkable to central park. 3 streets from Subway at 96st and plenty of places to eat nearby on Broadway, which is safe too. I would recommend, especially if you just need a clean place to sleep."

863568,49426040,2021-10-21,"Marianny’s place is just as shown in the pictures- so comfy and cozy with the most thoughtful details. The apartment is clean and feels like home! While i did not get the chance to meet Marianny in person, Kacey was very accommodating and helpful upon my arrival. There is parking on the property (perfect!!) and the entrance is well lit with locks to get into the main entrance and entrance to the apartment. The apartment is on the top floor, thus tucked away from the rest of the home. Wonderful and hospitable experience! Thank you, Marianny and Kacey!"
853040,48155868,2021-04-30,The room is tiny and I barely had space to move around. The common spaces are monitored by cameras so I didn’t feel comfortable using it. I guess it’s cheap for a reason.

2140,8490,2019-06-29,"Three sisters stayed here for two nights. We came by train, and it was easy to navigate from Penn Station to the subway station, then the (slightly under) 1/2 mile walk to the apartment. The neighborhood is very peaceful day and night. Nathalie was great about communication.<br/><br/>This apartment is on the second floor, and the staircase is kind of narrow (my sisters had big suitcases!), but just one flight. The apartment itself is lovely, large and has a great layout. It's one big room, with a sitting area and two beds on one side, kitchen with table in the middle, and queen bed on the other. The bathroom has a big tub and Nathalie's set up the shower curtains so it's easy to use it that way without spraying water all over. The enclosed outdoor space is pretty, but it was too hot for us to want to use it this time.<br/><br/>The air conditioner cools things down perfectly, and the bedding is comfy and towels plentiful. Nathalie has a fun sense of decor and that made this space extra special. We felt like it was a good value, and a great home base to explore NYC!"

Flat has all you need: towels, bedsheets for both bed and sofa, wifi, tea/coffee. Nearby plenty of places to eat, coffee shops and a very good Chinese restaurant is just next door. Flat is located 10-15 mins walking from Soho and shopping area. The price/value is very correct!"

It had a great aesthetic and was kept very tidy. <br/><br/>Beth, the host, was responsive and so helpful during our stay. She provided great recommendations for places to eat, and was readily available. Beth made sure that our stay exceeded our expectations. Given we are living in COVID times, Beth even made sure there was ventilation before we arrived by opening windows since the weather was terrific. Would recommend this place for anyone looking for a fun, relaxing getaway at Rockaway."
770432,37943668,2021-08-10,"Desiree's spot is in a great location and neighborhood in Brooklyn and represents the community that has long called Prospect Lefferts home. There's a warm and friendly vibe here, and guests are in the mix with family members, pets, and all the other signs of a vibrant life. Given that our stay was in the summer, having central air was key--and we even got a little chilly, so having an extra layer was good. Parking was a bit dicey, but we managed, sometimes having to circle for 15-20 minutes to find a spot. Not unusual for Brooklyn, though. The outside and entrance were very dark, so we had to use our phone flashlights upon arrival and when entering at night. There is a cat and a dog in the home, and both are very friendly with guests. We appreciated that Desiree made room for us to keep some food in the fridge during our stay, but we didn't really use the kitchen as it is well used by the family. Overall, we had a great stay and would definitely recommend to other folks interested in a private room stay in this part of Brooklyn."
787131,39820168,2021-10-23,I definitely recommend this place for any visitors coming to NYC. The host is friendly and an amazing person.

The Airbnb itself was spotless and incredibly clean. I really enjoyed the Airbnb as it has a great cozy feel, it’s a real good getaway if you need. The wifi in the Airbnb is better than my home so it wasn’t a problem working from there. The Airbnb is a light 10 minute walk from the beach, with plenty of stores around. Parking was real easy for find being it is Winter. I definitely recommend this Airbnb and would return one day, maybe during the summer :)"
567805,21969058,2021-09-18,"Very caring Host. My girlfriend and I were there for approximately 6 weeks. Very, very comfortable. Felt like a home away from home. Nice Brownstone Street. Just a couple of blocks away from a wonderful, very large Park, full of dogs, people playing chess, etc. We always felt safe and found this to be a very warm neighborhood.

110647,1347126,2020-02-09,"I had a really great stay at Brooke's place. She is a wonderful host. I had very interesting conversations with her and Carlos. The room is spacious and nice, has a comfortable bed, a big closet and a direct access to the bathroom. As the room is on the ground floor, you have a private entrance to your space. The kitchen upstairs is fully equipped and you can cook there if you like. As I stayed for 2 weeks, I found it very handy that there is also a washing machine where you can do your laundry, so you don't need to find a laundromat. It is a nice and safe neighbourhood with restaurants and cafés nearby. There are various bus lines you can use which take you to the nearest subway stations. And you have the Brooklyn Navy Yard ferry station just a few minutes walk away. The trip to go by ferry to Manhattan is just amazing. I would have loved to stay even longer and would come back anytime. I totally recommend staying at Brooke's place."

Tv is in bedroom, but bed was good so worked for me. <br/>Could use some more homey touches.<br/>Ex- Ceiling light in bedroom was exposed bulb. Main issue though is overly bright living room wall lights, need other lower lighting options in living room. I found myself using bedroom mostly bc too bright. Nonetheless, Gerardo is very responsive and tries to please, so is commendable. Overall recommended for stay, is good value."

Every evening after a long day of discovering the sights in Manhattan, we always looked forward to going home and enjoying a home cooked meal. This was never a problem, because a grocery store is right by the Subway stop that we got off at (Myrtle-Wyckoff). Being that the Subway is only a ten-minute walk away, traveling to and from the city was never an issue. Close bye are also many bodegas, restaurants and other useful places of business. <br/>Mansura and Raphael are exemplary hosts, with an eye for detail and a hand for creating an enjoyable homey atmosphere. I whole heartedly and without exception recommend this location.<br/><br/>P.S.: We are two adults and one five year old child."

140675,2137796,2019-07-13,"We recently stayed in this lovely apartment while visiting NYC. A perfect base for our visit. The apartment was beautiful and had everything we needed. It was clean and comfortable. A home away from home. From the moment we arrived we were welcomed by Richelle and Pela. Both such warm and welcoming and accommodating hosts. As we arrived early we were able to leave our luggage in the apartment. We were provided with some supplies in the fridge ( bagels, milk, eggs, juice, water, drinks) and toiletries in the bathroom. Nice touch. Easy commute to Manhattan by train. Short walk to subway.  It was lovely to explore the local area. We would highly recommend this place and we would definitely stay here again when next visiting NY."
768894,37800810,2019-09-04,Great location! Cozy bed and the apartment was clean
76582,765563,2019-10-22,"Norman’s place is at a perfect location, very close to 2 major highways, walking distance to coffee shop, restaurant. As advertised, He does have a 2 or 3 cars driveway, but cuz it’s a shared one, and lil narrow, so I didn’t want to take chance of hitting any cars, I only parked one car there and other on the street. There is no parking restrictions in that neighborhood, so parking on the street was easy anyways.<br/><br/>House itself is big, very good for large group of guests. It is an old house, but as Norman mentioned in other reviews, he’s updating it and making changes. He does have a pretty thorough description of the house, clearly explained everything that you need to know, so make sure to read it. I made a mistake of not reading the garbage section fully, and then leave the garbage outside and raccoon came and made a big mess. I can tell you, it wasn’t fun to clean that up. :-(<br/><br/>House is equipped with all necessary amenities, he even has a portable play-yard  and high chair for baby, which came very handy for our 1 year old.<br/><br/>Norman was very accommodating and quick to respond with any questions.<br/><br/>We stayed there for 8 nights, but 1 night (I think it was Sunday around 8 pm) we got a complaint from the neighbor for creating noise pollution. In our defense we were trying to put 3 kids in 2 different cars and that created the noise. In any case, just be careful about that.<br/><br/>Overall it was a good experience."
700207,31802641,2019-09-09,The host canceled this reservation 31 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
806236,42182307,2021-11-07,"The kitchen was disgusting , the room felt like a prison and there was no tv not one of the lightS on the room worked.. there was stains on the wall by the bed and the bed felt like sleeping on  rocks. NEVER AGAIN"
130848,1865336,2019-07-29,"Amazing apartment, amazing hosts and great location, 4th floor apartment just 12 steps from the roof top, which has fantastic views of Manhattan and the Williamsburg bridge. Our hosts made us feel totally at home, and we even got to sample Alana's fantastic food! <br/>Great location, just over the Williamsburg bridge from Manhattan, 5 minute walk to Marlow's cafe and and a fairly upmarket supermarket which was great for snack food and light meals. Really enjoyed our stay, and if ever we go back to NY, we will stay there again."

Anything I needed he offered me. I hate to give such a good review because I want to make sure it's available when I want to go to NYC again!"
737598,34709658,2019-07-26,"The apartment was what we expected—the pictures are accurate. It had everything we needed, was clean and chic, and was a great space that was perfect for our family of four. The location was convenient to the High Line, Hudson Yards area, The Vessel, Empire State Building, etc. The host was very responsive to messages. The only downside was the noise. It is located above a tire shop that operates from early morning-late night and also directly across from a major construction site that operates 24/7. The front room is loud 24/7. There are pocket doors so that the noise in the center area (futon, dining and kitchen area) are fine, and the back bedroom is actually quite quiet with the white noise of the air conditioner. These are things that the host can not control, but that it’s good for guests to be aware of and decide accordingly. The things that the host can control (the apartment itself and communication) were great. We’d stay there again!"
441506,15940176,2021-09-19,"My husband and I stayed at Marc's for 9 days and it was a great place to stay! Williamsburg is an awesome neighborhood, we were close to different subways, close to the Ferry. Marc was very flexible for our arrival and departure, we even forgot our keys one day and he helped us in the evening. The room is small but when you visit New-York, you don't spend much time in the bedroom anyway, so it was everything that we needed. The bed was comfortable, we were able to use the kitchen, good bathroom. We felt like at home! I highly recommend staying at Marc's, it's much cheaper than many other places and you still get a great deal, no regrets for us!"

567578,21964596,2019-07-17,"Peter’s apartment is located in a great area. It is not an upscale town, but I would describe it as safe and convenient. My partner and I were able to walk to the subway in under 10 minutes everyday, stop and chat with the neighbors on the tree lined street, shop for groceries at the corner stores and ate groceries (4 meals) for under $30.00. <br/>The apartment is very clean, private, and the area was not loud. Though it is not air conditioned, we did not have a need for cooling even in three days of the weather outside being between 85° to over 100°F. <br/>The drinking water had no off tastes to it, the shower temperatures heated up and cooled off quickly, and the wifi was fast. <br/>We had no complaints and were very impressed overall!"
576848,22376093,2020-03-05,"Stayed here for a month after relocating to NYC and it was a perfect apartment to get started here. Nice touches throughout the apartment that went a long way, well furnished kitchen, relaxing living room area, great bed and nice closet space. All in all a great place even for an extended stay like mine. <br/><br/>Apartment is on ground/street level though which wasn’t very clear before. It’s a very quiet street though so not much to worry about. <br/><br/>10/10 :)"

850883,47874453,2021-08-15,"I stayed in this Airbnb for 9 weeks in the Summer of 2021. Although I was suspicious at first, because this place didn't have any reviews, my stay was perfect! <br/><br/>Where should I start? <br/>The Airbnb has the perfect location: it's right between Soho, Little Italy & Chinatown. Everything is in walking distance, but in case you need to go somewhere further away, there are 3 subway stations that are a ca. 5min walk away.  Being in Soho/Nolita there are numerous cafés, restaurants and bars right around the corner. When you stay at this place, you truly feel like a local. <br/><br/>The Airbnb itself is modern, spacious and clean, and perfect for a single or a couple - even for a longer stay. It looks just like on the pictures. You have a separate entrance and it feels like your own studio. The only downside is that this Airbnb is on the 5th floor and there's no elevator, but you get used to it after a while. <br/><br/>Caitlin and Duane are amazing hosts. Communication was super easy and whenever I needed something, I just texted them and they were super prompt to reply and organize missing supplies. At the end of my stay they even hosted me for drinks at their apartment (which is next door). <br/><br/>I would  100% book this Airbnb again - highly recommended!"

If you are bringing a car, street parking is easy to find, and the food around the area is also really good. If you prefer to eat at home,  Kim's kitchen is big and she has everything you'd need to cook for yourself. Overall, it's a great value and I would highly recommend it!"

The apartment was decorated with fresh flowers and we had great range welcome food in the form of fruit, orange juice, sparkling water, pudding and milk. The check in was nice and easy as she was personally there to greet us and also when we checked out. She very kindly let us stay later than the check out time as our flight was in the evening for which we are very grateful. The bonus was the Brooklyn botanical garden family card which she gave us to use free of charge. The garden is a must see and we are very thankful for this nice gesture. Location wise it has all the necessary amenities like grocery store , deli,  bakery and take aways. Billys super market at 870 cypress avenue, ridge wood  is a great place to shop for all kind of necessary amenities under one roof and is at a walking distance from the apartment. The apartment is ideal for small families and very clean and comfortable. We felt very comfortable during our stay. Would definitely recommend this place."

I had a late flight on the check out date and Any was very flexible about the later check out time I asked for.  Also, I was there on Father's Day.  When I finished a shower Any greeted me with a tray with cake, coffee, and tea.  A very nice, friendly touch.  The room was quiet and the location of the apartment to the 52nd St. stop for the 7 train was exactly where I was looking to stay.

241273,6224336,2019-07-21,"Appartement effectivement bien localisé, proche du métro et du Manhattan,  silencieux- mais relatif (on attend les pas du voisin au dessus qui , heureusement, n'a pas fait la fête- mais on sait jamais). Par contre,  photos trompeuses: appartement bien petit, situé en demi-sol, beaucoup d'humidité (gare si allergie aux acariens), peu de lumière, aspect désordonné, propreté douteuse. Pouvait être OK en cas de prix bien plus bas + séjour sans aucune prétention. Mais ce n'était pas le cas: par exemple pour la même période et mêmes personnes j'aurais pu choisir Wyndham Hotel. Au total 300 euros de plus, mais conditions sans doute bien meilleurs + hôtel situé en plein Manhattan et non pas en Queens + petit-déj inclus. A posteriori c'était une meilleure affaire. Et encore , je n'ai pas  eu le temps de chercher davantage...Le rapport qualité /prix n'est finalement donc pas si bon qu'il parait."

612043,24823404,2021-10-23,"Bing is very responsive, I have to give her credit for that. However, the overall experience at the house was not the best. I highly doubt the janitorial staff had done much cleaning, as I’ve found a beer can under the sofa bed and other noticeable objects on the floor. The white bed sheets had numerous stains and hair on them. Even after the staff came to change sheets per my request, it was a marginal improvement (no hair, but still many large stains). The house is not located on a main road, but definitely not a quiet street, despite being in a residential neighborhood. We’ve heard trucks passing by at 10:30pm and people shouting, door slamming past midnight. If you intend to take a shower, I’d advise you bring your own soap as the shower gel bottle was empty during my stay."
660672,28711792,2019-03-11,"Such a beautiful and peaceful space for a night in NYC. Very close to all kinds of amazing things to do in NYC and to public transit options. Vibrant textiles and lively plants throughout the space. <br/><br/>Note that you will need to go up 5 flights of stairs and if you are driving that street parking can be challenging in the area (lots of no parking areas or 2hr only, as well as closed off construction areas while I was there).  Avenue A is a busy area and at least on the weekends is pretty loud until 3 or 4 am if you struggle with street noise or drunk people yelling. (I dig the sounds of the city and am used to it so slept fine)."
221075,5224210,2021-07-18,"Another great stay at home away from home in Brooklyn. Clean, convenient accommodations. The only heads up I'll give to travelers is bring a baby gate for small children (there are stairs in the home) and pay attention to parking rules (typical for anywhere in the city!)."
211488,4739557,2019-02-22,Loydeen was super responsive and helpful. Would consider staying again if in NY.
745606,35386161,2019-06-15,"Erika’s place located probably the coolest site of NYC and Williamsburg Brooklyn, near the Bedford Av. subway station. Just a few meters from the apartment there’s the best bars (our favorite was the Lucky Dog), restaurants (Maison Premiere) and events (Smorgasburg) of Williamsburg. The wonderful Domino Park on the side of East River also just a few blocks away, so the location is more than perfect. <br/><br/>Erika is living in a 3 bedroom apartment which is very practical and cozy. Our bedroom was a friendly small and clean room, we loved it. We could also use the kitchen  (which is well equiped) and the living room. Erika has two beautiful cats who we loved very much!<br/><br/>Erika and Anwar are the perfect hosts, they are friendly, helpful and kind persons. Two great persons and a lovely place - highly recommend!"

Thomas is a cool cat you may meet if you’re lucky. <br/>The treehouse is quite an experience and I’d love to come back. <br/>Overall, this is a solid spot"

456001,16613747,2019-11-08,"I had a great stay at Jonathan’s place. Johnathan is a great host and also a friendly guy. The room is cosy and clean and I loved the big windows with the sunlight and view of the garden. <br/>The place is conveniently located near the L train, which gets you quickly to Manhattan or other places in Brooklyn. Be sure to ask Johnathan for tips he has been living in the city for a long time and knows where to go to."

212011,4756578,2019-07-15,"Great location with many restaurants and boutiques within walking distance!  <br/>The Home:  Very spacious for a family of 4!! The master bedroom/bathroom is on the first floor along with the kitchen.  On the second floor you will find the 2nd bedroom and living room with plenty of natural light!!  The 2nd bathroom is located another level (just a couple of steps up) above the living room and just next to the bathroom is a door that leads you to the outdoor deck — super dope!!! Their condo is kept clean and tidy with just about everything you need!! I would definitely stay here again and again!! <br/><br/>The Location:  I marvel at the fact that it was super convenient to get back to JFK using the station at Marcy Ave which is about a mile walk (we ubered to the Marcy Ave Jamaica Center station instead and it cost about $8.00) and jumped on the AirTrain from there. We left the condo about 3pm and it took us about 1 hour and 25 minutes or less to get to Terminal 5.  Beats sitting in traffic!!<br/><br/>Checking in and out:  super easy—getting the keys and surrendering them was cake!! Walk about a block and a half from the apt to the designated spot and pick em up.  However, when you drop the keys off, they charge you a $2 fee.  <br/><br/>The Food:  If you like Chinese food, there’s a great spot, Wei Williamsburg, that has one of the best soup dumplings EVER and pork belly fried rice!!<br/>There’s also a place called SweetChick that’s about half a mile from the condo that has awesome chicken and waffles!!<br/><br/>Thanks for letting us enjoy Williamsburg like a local!!"
841924,46750389,2020-12-26,Excelente place. 100% recommendable
878541,51000579,2021-07-25,"The bedroom was a decent size however the mattress was very dirty, with a bad, bad smell of cigarette, it looked like they came from a garbage,  and was very uncomfortable to sleep on it, I don't even cover myself with the only one sheet, it was  uncomfortable. We left with a lot of sleep from sleeping uncomfortably plus the shower with dirty curtain, with mold and stagnant water. <br/>We chose to sleep here because in the photos it looked clean, two beds and our own bathroom, when we arrived very tired from the trip, all you want is to sleep, rest but it was a nightmare, I would never have imagined that they would do something like that, it was very night and  I was not going to start looking for another place, because I do not know New York and much less wanting to drive at night knowing that there is nowhere to park. Very disappointed about this place."
219146,5040653,2021-10-19,"Great space, in a great location.  Clean, comfortable, convenient.  Would stay there again. A+"
709785,32669154,2019-11-05,Gwen’s Place was perfect for my needs. She’s a quick walk to the G train and near several bus routes for Brooklyn travels. There’s not a lot of amenities but Gwen was very responsive throughout the stay. The place was clean.
108614,1291261,2021-07-25,"My wife and I stayed at Light and Monica’s apartment for 1 month. The location was fantastic, walking distance to many great restaurants and bars and the subway station. <br/><br/>The apartment itself was spacious and it was great having clear areas for a living room, kitchen, bedroom, etc. Also, the windows did a really great job keeping the noise from the streets out sleeping was not a problem. <br/><br/>Can’t wait to come back to NYC soon!"
388628,13564134,2019-10-10,"L'appartement se trouve dans un quartier populaire. Il est au rez-de-chaussée haut et les deux chambres à l'arrière sont par conséquent sombres. Nous avons choisi cet appartement pour avoir chacun sa chambre, ce qui était bien pour nous. La déco est kitch et vieillotte. L'éclairage est celui d'une salle d'opération et il n'y a pas de lampes de chevet, par contre télé dans chaque pièce, ce que je trouve personnellement plutôt dépriment qu'autre chose... Sinon, l'appartement est calme et bien situé pour utiliser les transports en communs, ce qui est appréciable pour se rendre rapidement à Manhattan. On peut même prendre le bus M3 qui passe juste devant la maison et nous amène directement à Washington Square, c'est pratique quand on est avec des personnes qui ont du mal à se déplacer, ce qui était notre cas. Nous avons pu cuisiner le soir ce  qui était pratique pour nous."

It's an easy 5 minute stroll from Parkchester metro station and Bronx Zoo is a 35 minute transit ride away although disappointingly no lions or tigers or bears seem to have made the journey despite Miguel's entertaining review :D<br/><br/>Ruby herself was extraordinarily accommodating: kindly taking a parcel for me prior to my arrival, preparing homemade breakfast every morning and taking me on an impromptu tour of City Island among other hidden local treasures. As well as being an attentive host she also makes a fantastically knowledgeable tour guide and with her being so well read there was never a dull conversation.

Hope we can come back soon!"
5969,18152,2019-03-10,"This apartment was in a great location! It was in the UES but not too close to Central Park, so the neighbourhood was pretty quiet. However, it was only a 30ish minute walk from Central Park, and there are lots of food places nearby! The place is very small, which is hard to tell from the lack of pictures on the listing. It was just my boyfriend and I staying with her, and we didn’t plan on being in the apartment much, so it was fine. Queen sized bed; very comfortable. There is a little storage thing by the bed for you to put stuff, and she has a great heater in the room. Bathroom is very small, but the shower was nice; very clean and had a high shower head. Her cat, Gus, is absolutely precious - so sweet and beautiful. He does meow some in the middle of the night, so that’s something to consider if you aren’t a huge fan of cats or already struggle sleeping through the night. I have a cat who wakes me up, so it didn’t bother me! The apartment is in a gated location, and there is a main gate with a lock and key to enter the complex, so it’s pretty safe! Victoria was very nice and welcoming, and her place was great for our quick trip to NYC!"

663627,28938342,2019-04-30,"Miao was an excellent anfitrion! He was always worried about my status and asking me if I needed something. The apartment is as expected in the photos although my room was a little bit more smaller than my imagination (maybe my imagination is not as good as I think). There is a subway very close to the apartment and a store to buy everything on the way home so it is perfect for logistic issues. There are also places for having lunch/dinner close to the subway station.<br/>The room was equiped with a smart TV with allows me to connect my hardisk and also watch Netflix, which is very kind if you want to just rest.<br/>The only thing is that from the apartment to the middle of Manhattan you need a little bit more time than I expect although but it is also understandable because New York is huge.<br/>To sum up, I will strongly recommend Miao apartment if you want a place outside Manhattan and you want a person that takes care of you in any moment.<br/>My personal rating is 9/10 :-)"

586750,23034152,2019-05-17,"We had a great stay at Ian's apartment. The apartment gets a lot of sun and it was very nice and clean. It looks exactly what you see in the pictures (*No photoshop or brightness adjustment). Ian had a couple of umbrellas for his tenants to use. That was very thoughtful touch. The building has no elevator and it's on the 5th floor so if you have a stroller or other big items with you, it might be hard to deal with. Ian warned us in advance about this but we still booked this place. You’ll get good exercise! No laundry on site but there is a laundromat across the street and they do fluff and fold. Location was very convenient and lots of options to eat within blocks. Trader Joe’s is located on 93rd and other local grocery stores are within a block. The closest subway lines are B and C local (5-6min walk) and if you walk to either 86th or 79th you have 1 local train. You can also walk to Central Park, libraries, and various museums(American Museum of Natural History, the Met, Guggenheim etc). Construction was going on next door while we were staying there and the loud noise started around 7/7:30am on weekdays so if you are sensitive to noise, you might want to consider it. Ask Ian about it, he’ll answer your questions kindly. Overall, I’m very happy that I found Ian’s apartment!!"

165973,3279671,2021-05-31,"An amazing an accommodating host. The place is tucked away in a quiet area that is conveniently located around the corner from everything. There's a great super market, a whole foods, and a host of restaurants at your fingertips for order or a simple walk. Madison Square Garden to the Empire State Building are in walking distance. A cozy, quiet place not too far from the NYC life and action. You're a moment away from everything New York is known for, and you can return to a very quiet and comfortable place once the outdoor party's over. To add, the building too is a nice community of people."

We literally could’ve walked to everything we needed including subway stops, parks, drug stores, grocery, Manhattan skyline…and anything else you may need. I would rent this home again and again, we travel to NYC usually once a year and this place is the best!

865026,49484536,2021-08-19,"I can’t imagine a more quintessential Brooklyn stay than an RV on the streets of Brooklyn. We we’re justifiably hesitant given that you don’t know what you’re getting into when you stay in an RV with a complete stranger, but Tim was the most polite and kind mannered host I’ve ever had the pleasure of staying with and he was a big part of our memorable trip. I will 100% consider staying here again for another trip. We had so much fun we literally got tattoos of RV’s while we were in New York. I don’t know how else to explain how much we enjoyed our stay there other than to say we GOT TATTOOS OF THE RV."

Neighbors are bit sensitive, we did experience some noise complaint from the neighbor, other than that our stay was pleasant, we had to limit family visits. Street parking is difficult, I recommend renting private parking from Adrian if you plan to drive. If you plan to stay long term make sure you make arrangements with Adrian to make space in the draws as it were all occupied with Adrians belongings. He was nice enough to empty out the draws to make space for our stuff. The balcony is a nice space to get some fresh air. Overall its a 5 star rating from me."

360735,12272376,2020-07-03,"This was such a fun stay! My husband and I loved grilling on the deck and chilling on the roof. The bed was comfy and the kitchen and living area perfectly suited our needs. It's home with a quirky, kitschy feel. It's clear that a lot of love has gone into the place. It was a such a unique experience to wake up and go to sleep in the marina after gorgeous days at the beach. Ben was super responsive and helpful before and throughout the stay. We highly recommend the James Franco!"

I had to begin looking for another stay and my 3000+ would still have to take 5 business days to be refunded which is not cheap. If you love yourself save yourself from the headache. When Airbnb finally got in touch with Alex he claimed someone else booked the stay and that he had a glitch on his Airbnb. He said he would help me find another place and I never heard from him again. Lately there has been a lot of scams on Airbnb save yourself from the stress and book with people with multiple reviews"

700407,31834008,2019-08-04,"We enjoyed our stay. The location was pretty convenient to most of the local attractions we planned to visit. Our host Sharon was very accommodating and responsive. The property was very clean and close to the Shirley Chisholm State Park, Coney Island, and the Canarsie Pier. We will definitely be recommending this place to our friends and also plan on returning ourselves."
830866,45690330,2021-11-28,Joshua is extremely friendly and kind. He made me feel right at home as if I was with family. He's very attentive and ensures you have a comfortable stay.
834416,46038559,2021-08-23,"Close to Columbia Campus, taqueria y fonda, and the Hungarian Pastry.<br/><br/>Very cozy accommodation!"
865955,49610751,2021-09-16,"I enjoyed staying at David's place!<br/><br/>Pros: <br/>- Great location<br/>- Super comfortable mattress<br/>- David and his family (including the lovely dog Princess) are super nice, flexible, generous and welcoming. They allowed me to check in early, helped me in getting around, and made me feel welcome. <br/><br/>Cons:<br/>- You will be sleeping in a bedroom inside a cozy home, shared by David and his family (you will not have the cozy home for yourself, as I misunderstood from the name of this listing). This means that you won't get much privacy or space. For example, David was sleeping on the sofa in the living room just outside my door. If you are looking for a homey atmosphere this can be great, but if privacy and space are important for you, this would not be my first choice."
540181,20826700,2020-02-24,"Great location near to good food spots as well as the subway. Very clean place with towels, soap etc. provided. Easy check in and check out. Recommended !"
863468,49423451,2021-09-06,"Place was ok for the price. It had good size beds and good amenities. The water gets boiling hot really quickly. There were bed bugs in the queen bed. There was a group of like 20-30 kids constantly outside the Airbnb smoking, playing basketball, and blocking the park way. Don’t think I would ever rebook this place, but it gets the job done."
862161,49289463,2021-08-14,Great time. Walking distance from Coney Island. Good check in process
711527,32818195,2019-05-05,"This place was just right.  Quiet and comfortable so you feel at home,  Union Square and many restaurants just around the corner.  Definitely a great value."

680758,30156908,2019-09-27,"This apartment is as shown, and is clean and very well located. The instructions for access were confusing (and not correct), and there was no information on wifi access and any local suggestions once inside. This sets up disappointment and places responsibility on the visitor to chase the host for basic info. It doesn't take much to go a little further for a more enjoyable stay. The check-in process was not as good as it could have been; after such a long flight its good to have all the information provided."

Especially I love the fact that the place is super clean and I can’t forget taking a warm shower every morning. The room is really cozy and the apartment is so lovely. You share the bathroom with the other guest and the host, Aleksandra though, I did never have any issue using the bathroom. The bathroom is really clean and everything is prepared like towel, dryer and shampoo & body wash that smell so good. The apartment is super close to the subway station, Q<br/>Q line is the one that passes by most of touristy places in Manhattan. If you take an Express, it would take around 25-30 mins. I don’t really take a train back in LA due to weirdos, I really enjoy taking a subway here in NYC. You can get to see pretty cool people with a sense of unique fashion. I’m a girl and I didn’t have a trouble going home even after 10PM, which means it’s a safe area. I really enjoyed staying at her place :) price-wise, it was good ! Thank You Aleksandra, wish you the best luck with everything !"

831110,45718510,2020-11-17,The space is in what seemed to be a multiple generations living quarters in the basement with only a curtain to separate you from their living quarters. It felt safe and was clean but wasn’t as private as I thought it would be. They are kind and accommodating. It’s a simple set up and worked for what I needed which was a place to store my bags and sleep for three nights. The amenities are new and clean. I would definitely recommend this place to someone needing a night or two. Thank you for having me. X

852121,48027017,2021-03-29,"After reading reviews we decided to give this place a shot. Overall, its an OK stay. The beds are uncomfortable and hard. Room was clean, although it looks way bigger in the pictures. Room was a bit tight in space. <br/>Also be ware of unexpected fees such as parking.

Elizabeth was very flexible in helping me make arrangements.  The room was well furniture and clean.  The house was quiet, although you can sometimes hear street noise.  Kitchen facility was fine for my needs of making tea or a snack.  There is a 7-Eleven right across the street which was convenient for drinks and snack. There are many restaurants within walking distance, especially on Cortelyou Road.  I walked back and forth to my daughter's apartment over a mile away and felt safe, even after 9 at night.  It is a pretty neighborhood."

Great value!"
4498,15711,2019-10-18,"The place is amazing. It's situated next to a little park and a few blocks of the Central Park, the lane 6 subway and the citibikes. You can go to any place using these transportation. The only bad thing about this apartment is that the building hasn't elevator, so you have to use the stairs to reach the fifth floor. Keep this in mind if you travel with senior people. About the place, it's perfect for 5 or 6 people. Has one main bedroom, with a king bed, and a secondary bedroom with two smalls beds.

Comfortable temperature in December, wood floors are not cold. The neighborhood is a little noisy, but that's expected for Washington Heights. The windows insulated the sound well enough to not bother me. I don't believe the building has an elevator, so you'll need to be able to climb a few flights of stairs, not bad. Be aware that the 1 train is not stopping at the 168th street station due to construction supposedly scheduled to be completed Jan 2020 (A/C trains do stop there)."

Joe was a good host and it was easy sharing the apartment with him. The apartment itself is a ground level apartment and kind of smells like a basement which didn't bother us much. If you're looking to have a 5 star hotel experience this is not the right place for you, but if you want to feel like a local  New Yorker then Joe's apartment is a great option."

Thanks James, you are a thoughtful host."

761786,37093438,2021-05-31,"The stay was ok. It’s in a convenient location , so getting to things was easy HOWEVER, the overall value of the place is not very good . The place was not clean properly at all. The furniture was in a deplorable condition.  Very dingy furniture . The shower was nice but not cleaned which brought down the value of the place especially the toilet bowl was not clean at all . Also the place was very cold i was trembling the entire time . This place has great potential to be better  with better maintenance. Stay at your convenience."

278431,7927838,2019-05-25,多くのﾚﾋﾞｭｰｺﾒﾝﾄに記載されているとおり､ﾎｽﾄJasonの人柄は素晴らしく､随所に彼の心配りを感じることができました。部屋はとても綺麗で広いうえに明るくて必要なｱﾒﾆﾃｨも用意されていましたので滞在中とても心地よく過ごすことができました。ﾁｪｯｸｲﾝが夜の11時半頃になったのですが､ﾒｯｾｰｼﾞをすればすぐに返事が来て､快くOKしてくれました。また駅までも徒歩1分でとても便利です。夜11時ごろに娘と女二人でお酒を買出しに近所を歩いたのですが､治安も特に問題ありませんでした。本当にｺｽﾄﾊﾟﾌｫｰﾏﾝｽのよい宿です。Airbnbのすべての宿がこうあるべきだと思います。
888835,52444000,2021-11-10,"Great location, safe neighborhood. the room (including bathrooms and kitchen) was so clean and warm. I’d definitely book this room again!"
740573,35050365,2020-02-18,"We really enjoyed our stay here. The space was simply but stylishly decorated, there are lots of great bars and restaurants in the area, it's not too far from several metro stops, and communication with Elaine was great. Our only complaints would be the thin ceilings (we were awakened by the sound of footsteps above early in the morning) and for someone like me who gets cold easily it was a bit chilly but extra blankets were provided. Overall a lovely place, would definitely recommend!"
799743,41274329,2021-08-31,"It was a good stay for a month , quite and comfortable, it’s Asian  neighborhood , stores and restaurants one block away , also few blocks it’s sunset park with public pool in the summer , 30 minute train ride to manhattan ."
695177,31269703,2019-02-16,You’ll be in a very comfortable location. When you need the quietness from the hustle and bustle of the city this is the place to retreat to. Monique has saved you the trouble of looking for something to order for delivery if you’re hungry. Her instructions are clear and easy to follow. Monique was a great host and I’d definitely consider staying here again.

189956,4077744,2021-07-16,"Agha es muy atento y responde muy rápido a los mensajes. Para mi y mi pareja fue un problema que el departamento haya tenido todos los closets y refrigerador llenos de pertenencias del anfitrión. Habíamos arrendado 3 semanas para encontrar un hogar permanente en NY. No teníamos espacio para dejar nuestras cosas, y como el refrigerador estaba completamente lleno de comida, era incomodo tener nuestra propia comida. El resto estuvo muy bien, muy bien ubicado, el edificio estupendo."

335526,10369038,2020-01-15,"Amy's house is a very standard home in Flushing. There's 3 bedrooms and only one room has a private bathroom so the other 2 rooms will have to be shared, so keep that in mind when booking. If you walk to Main St (roughly 9 blocks away) there are lots of restaurants. We ate at Coco Rooster which was absolutely amazing (they serve hot pot and other rice/noodle/Asian casserole dishes). It is also located a walking distance to Queens Hospital. The room we stayed in was spacious and came with a large closet, a dressing table, double bed, a trash can, and a nightstand. The only issue we really had was we were under the impression that this was a one bedroom unit and that we would be the only ones staying here since it said one bedroom, and we ended up having to share a bathroom with another guest who had 2 children with them. Communication was great and the women who checked us in was so sweet and helpful. She even made sure we were doing alright and had toiletries with us when we came back from dinner at around 11pm. Overall, not bad and would book again in the future"
256638,6808818,2020-01-19,"Great host.  Clean,  quiet, and cozy place.  Would recommend"

Nice outside neighborhood and good parking. The host were very friendly, respectful & helpful, nor were they a burden. If I was to come back to NY I would much consider this place again."

106866,1223230,2019-11-23,"We stayed in Jackie's charming NYC loft for about a week. It was a great location, with so many of Manhattan's highlights either a short walk or subway trip away. It's a large space and full of natural light.<br/><br/>Shower and central heating both worked well. We found the bed uncomfortable, but slept ok and there was remarkably little street noise given the location.<br/><br/>As flagged by the host, there is no kitchen sink but we didn't find this to be an issue and there was plenty of cutlery and crockery. Jackie was a communicative and accommodating host, who made check-in a breeze."
657979,28489062,2019-05-12,"Best location in Brooklyn. The subway is literally at the end of the street. The park is two streets over. There are quaint cafes  all over. And that’s not even talking about the apartment! The perfect size for 2-4 people, the beds were cozy, the layout perfect, the interior design classy, and the best place to stay for our NYC trip. After long days walking all over Manhattan and Brooklyn it was a pleasure coming home to this haven to decompress and rest. Thanks so much Scott for letting us stay in the downstairs apartment. It was perfect."
491078,18411446,2019-09-29,Great place for a relaxing getaway! The spa bathroom was amazing! Plus walking distance to the Mets game!
752335,36102578,2019-07-22,"Beautiful apartment with a nice location near the train station. There was a parking place just beside the house on the street, very convenient! Gabriel & Aquanna were great hosts, they even provided us with snacks and drinking water. The place was perfect for our stay with a family of 5. It was nicely decorated and totally spotless. Well equipped too! The aircondition worked well in living areas but it didn't quite reach the bedrooms though. At the time of our visit there was a heatwave in the area, so the heat problem was understandable. We could sleep ok thanks to the newly installed fans. Thanks again, we had a fantastic stay!"
873858,50494788,2021-08-13,"This was the best airb place that I've ever stayed in. Beautifully decorated, neat, and clean. The view is to die for! They are excellent host! I definitely recommend their place!"
884959,51888170,2021-09-30,"Great room in a nice area of Brooklyn a block away from the subway station.  Clean is an amazingly nice, gracious and helpful host.

885598,51944795,2021-10-30,Good value - great location- nice staff - and clean rooms.   This is however a hotel which due to Covid is being run an an Airbnb - so my only issue is that it would have been nice to have a bit more personal service once your already there and pondering an extension vs having to run everything through Airbnb’s chat app.  With that in mind - I’d probably stay here again.
788554,39903508,2020-11-12,We really enjoyed our stay here. It was very clean and comfortable. No issues whatsoever and would happily stay here again in the future. Great location that’s close to shopping and bus routes.
803974,41811144,2020-02-25,"My boyfriend, brother, and I had to find an Airbnb to stay at since our apartment was being worked on. Honestly, I was having such a rough week and Myrma’s home was just absolutely amazing and made my day. From the little goodies they gave us to the hand written letter thanking me for my service and just the cleanliness of the apartment, it was an amazing stay! OH and they even left goodies for my doggos! I definitely recommend to stay here."

631716,26351621,2019-06-14,"This is a beautiful apartment and I would definitely stay here again. Owen is great to communicate with, the apartment was super clean and the space is really sweet. The space is best for one person or a couple with little luggage and no mobility issues (4th floor walkup). Incredible light throughout the whole apartment. Such a nice spot in Fort Greene."
591093,23376196,2021-09-29,"Super cute, functional place close enough to public transit but far enough out to be quiet. We walked around the neighborhood every night and always felt safe. Sunny was incredibly kind the one time our paths happened to cross. The apartment is really well decorated in a way that makes great use of the space and the lone window in the bedroom lets in lots of light during the day.  We never heard any street noise at all and all the neighbors were also quiet and considerate. This was a part of Bed Stuy I’d never been to, but was super happy with both the neighborhood and apartment. Thanks for a great stay!"

No typical nyc traffic noise. The neighbors were also respectful and quiet at night.  The beach was super close. Will def stay with Natalya again; the location and quiet neighborhood changed my whole view on where to stay while visiting nyc. <br/><br/>Took exactly an hr to get into Chinatown via the Q, but the time passes quickly."

538549,20788473,2020-09-25,"what can I say....? first off I`ll say here and now, I don't think the pictures posted by Audlyn did much justice, you just HAVE to go there and experience how wonderful the place is, added to the convenience to get around, food, park, bus.. everything you expected to have at a home was there and available to use,(parking was a plus) my only sour point was the fact that the tenants above were just overbearing with their noise which started from early in the mornings and went on most nights after 11.30, but if you are a person that`s 'NOT"" like my wife who NEEDED to sleep and get up early in the mornings for work, then you are good to go (keeping it honest) that being said, I`ll book again the FIRST opportunity I get providing the spot is available ..."

There is a bath and a half.  After check in, my husband and I never saw the host, so we had the use of both baths."

Though he was helpful and kept in communication, it was a little weird that it wasn’t the same person as listed. Regardless, the stay was worth the price. The room was as depicted and equipped with air conditioning. The bed was comfortable for one person. The bathroom was not very clean, although I do understand it is a shared space I don’t think there should be grime in the corners of the tub and under the toilet seat. The kitchen/living area was clean, as shown on the listing. Overall the experience was worth the low price."

I did ask about this and they are aware of it and there does not seem to be any plans to fix it.<br/>The TV uses FIOS but only has local stations. Sadly, there didn't seem to be enough bandwidth to change the channels without losing connection for up to a minute. This was reported and I was given the impression that this was not known but we'll be addressed. <br/>Upon checkout, we noticed that under the bed had not been cleaned in a while. But that was the only cleanliness issue and I'm certain that it well be rectified.<br/><br/>Overall:<br/>We would certainly consider this property in the future and recommend staying there if you visit New York City."

676273,29906282,2019-06-08,"Dawa & Phurpa's place in Jackson Heights is a spacious, very clean and nicely decorated place. It is close to public transit (the subway is a 12 minute walk away at 74th and Roosevelt) and is very comfortable. The bed was comfy, the light through the saffron yellow curtains was lovey and the living room was a great place to hang out after running all over the city. Also, the apartment is on the first floor, only up two or three steps, and gets plenty of light  The apartment looks like it was newly renovated and the kitchen and bathroom were well appointed and spotless. Communication with Dawa & Phurpa was very timely and easy. And now for the neighborhood: Jackson Heights is a very safe, family oriented neighborhood made up of people from all over the world. There is great, reasonably priced food in Jackson Heights including Pio Pio, Bocaito, Queensboro and if you want to up your game for a special dinner, try Addictive Wine Bar. I highly recommend Dawa & Phurpa's place!!"

I found I need a lot effort to adjust myself to live there. 1, I need to learn how to use match to light the stove; 2, I need to be super gentle and quiet to walking, to open/close doors, to wash dishes...all the time, because C-S is very sensitive to sound and works in the midnights and sleep at anytime; 3, also I feel uncomfortable to see her standing in the kitchen without any clothes...I guess it is normal in some cultures, but grew up in a conservative culture; 4, She also does not allow me to open the window in my room and etc. When we have differences and conflicts, she looks scary...and very angry...5, maybe because I was nervous, even though I used earplugs in the evening, I still could hear the noise outside and couldn’t have a good sleep..."

She provided a welcome book with lots of info and recommendations for the area, and communicated quickly and clearly.

404779,14274403,2019-05-19,"10/10 would recommend Laverne and David’s place if you are visiting New York. The place is spotless, bed is very comfortable. Less than 5 minutes from LGA, and only a short trip to get over to Manhattan. Very responsive to any questions that you may have as well."
13920,56859,2021-09-06,"Room is as advertised. Can be loud on the street and sometimes loud music on weekends. <br/>The location was great, very convenient to go out to brunch before we went to our festival on Randalls Island."
750737,35832547,2019-07-01,Gorgeous and spacious apartment that was in such a great central location. Host was incredibly helpful with suggestions on places to go in the city and was always available if we needed to communicate throughout our entire stay.
373488,13004996,2021-10-01,"I booked Beth’s place last minute for a week of working remotely and surfing mornings or evenings. It was perfect. The studio is  ideal for a solo traveler or couple. Loved the modern yet cozy decor. Amazing new kitchen with dining table that also made a great desk. Everything was as described/pictured, super clean and well stocked with everything you could possibly need. The hot and cold outdoor shower was a plus to rinse off after surfing. The studio is close to the subway and just a short walk to the beach. Also right next to the best taco place in town and close to Rockaway Beach Bakery. Beth and Keone were wonderful hosts, so nice and super accommodating. Will definitely come back."
621349,25460977,2019-11-17,Isaac’s place is very clean and cozy. Even the location is in Brooklyn but it’s convenient and easy to access the subway to the city. 24/7 market nearby is also a plus. I booked this Airbnb for out girls trip and we would love to stay here again in NYC.

702107,31950380,2019-07-13,"Good value at previous pricing.  Host told me I could use barbecue and gazebo on roof, but when I asked again about using it I was told it wasnt included in rental.  Listing had $15 for each additional guest, but host wanted $25 in cash.  I paid the extra 50 for the 2 days my guest stayed through Airbnb site.  Host has 2 dogs, one a very large German shepherd, but that wasnt mentioned in the ad, and I didnt find out about them until pulling up to check in.  The dogs barked a lot.  On my last night, host asked me what time I was checking out.  When I said I would be out by the 1100 am checkout time, she stated that it would be better for us to leave by 0830 becuase she had to work at 0900 and need time to clean the room for the next guest.  I felt more like the host was more about the money than my experience in staying my first time in an Airbnb."
534337,20639628,2019-02-18,"MELHOR CASA DO BROOKLIN! A casa é muito boa, quartos privativos com aquecedor central, cozinha, sala e banheiro compartilhado, mas bem limpos! O anfitrião não fica na casa, ela é apenas para hóspedes, o que fez uma grande diferença pois nos deu mais liberdade. A localização e excelente.  @gabrielkanesi <br/><br/>BEST BROOKLIN HOUSE!

890249,52718058,2021-11-07,I really enjoyed my stay in this apartment. It’s a super nice one bedroom apartment. It was clean and spacious. It was easy to check in on my own and easy to find the apartment. It is on the second floor so I was thankful it was only a few stairs since there is no elevator in the apartment building. The host thoughtfully left towels for my use along with shampoo and soap. He was also very responsive when I messaged him with a few questions and also messaged me to make sure everything was going well with my stay. The apartment is easy walking distance to the train and the park. There is an above ground train that goes by right outside the apartment that can be heard frequently however that did not bother me or disturb my sleep. Just part of the background noise of the city. There are also several grocery stores and pharmacies located nearby. Parking is always hard in the city but I was able to park in a garage nearby and just leave my car there for my entire stay.  I felt safe walking around the neighborhood even when coming home late. I would definitely stay here again!

338600,10546254,2021-07-25,"This cozy spot is in the perfect location in Brooklyn. Walk to Fort Greene farmer's market, tons of great food, and many subway lines. It's an easy Citibike to Williamsburg or Cobble Hill. The clean, comfortable space feels bigger than a typical studio because of the separate kitchen,big walk-in closet, and the configuration of the space. I worked (and worked out) here for weeks and had plenty of room for everything. Joanna was a gracious host, and even helped me move stuff in from my car (street parking was pretty manageable in the neighborhood, btw). The fresh flowers felt welcoming. I'd definitely stay here again!"

278420,7927838,2019-03-15,"Such an amazing room! Definitely worth it. My friend and I are young and in college so we were very skeptical about choosing a place to go since we’re two young women that haven’t traveled out of state before. But we felt super safe, the space was phenomenal and definitely made us at ease when we rested our heads after a day in the city. The surrounding area is full of culture, amazing people and wonderful places too eat. Definitely will be returning in the near future"

260400,6992831,2021-09-21,Couldn’t have asked for a better location. A few streets from the subway and a short walk to Milk and Honey (which I highly recommended checking out). The bonus is how comfortable the bed is. Great place to crash during your trip and a good value.
665276,29054423,2021-11-08,"Si están buscando un excelente alojamiento para su estadía en NYC este es el ideal, la verdad es que no tengo más que agradecer a José y Robertina por recibirnos en su casa y ayudarnos a que nuestras vacaciones fueran las mejores.<br/>El departamento se encuentra en un barrio tranquilo, es un barrio de gente latina en su mayoría, por lo que si no hablas tan bien el inglés, puedes comunicarte fácilmente. Caminando se hacen 5 minutos a la parada del metro y tiene una línea que te conecta con Manhattan en alrededor de 20 minutos, nosotros llegamos a caminar muy de noche y siempre se mostró todo seguro.<br/>La recamara era un espacio bastante amplio, con una cama queen, refrigerador y una mesita que nos ayudó mucho especialmente en las noches cuando regresábamos cansados y queríamos cenar ahí, todo estaba impecable de limpio, la calefacción funcionaba perfecto, y la casa era un refugio perfecto para  descansar cada  noche que regresábamos exhaustos luego de todo lo que caminas por allá. El baño era compartido, pero jamás batallamos con ello, nunca tuvimos que esperar para usarlo,  y siempre estuvo muy limpio también.<br/>Una de las noches de nuestra estadía José nos invitó a dar un paseo y conocer lugares que no son tan turísticos, él nos llevó en su auto propio y nos mostró lugares increíbles, siempre estaremos agradecidos por ello.<br/>La comunicación fue excelente, José nos respondía en menos de dos minutos, nos ayudaba a encontrar la mejor manera de trasladarnos y nos explicaba con precisión todas nuestras dudas.<br/>Muchas Gracias José y Robertina! Fueron unos excelentes anfritriones, y estamos seguros de que el día que volvamos a NYC nos volveremos a hospedar con ustedes!"

871016,50132200,2021-10-09,The place was okay but the carbon monoxide was going off and the bad part is that I have a small kid that is dangerous and was waking her up and whoever is living there I couldn’t even go food shopping because things was left in the fridge and freezer dirty washcloth and towels was left for me to use they was Absolutely no space for me to use anything or store it during my stay last minute communication for me to check out early for the host to clean the apartment for the next guest not good at all one finally one broken A/C in the main room they have a laundry room located on the basement level but all the washers and dryers was broken
782485,39334332,2021-02-04,"Location is great and it was nice I had the place to myself because the hosts were out. However, no windows so no natural lighting which during Covid felt like prison. There is not heat, no hair dryer, and a lot of other amenities listed. The upstairs neighbors were very loud at all hours of the day until 1 a.m. I had to initiate conversation to verify the address a day before. Even to check-out, they didn’t follow up to see how everything was going. I won’t be staying here again. This is very disappointing because I haven’t had issues with any Airbnb hosts."
638770,26948562,2019-12-01,"Adam's place was clean, comfortable, great location and amenities. Check in and out was easy. Would stay again and highly recommend."
705739,32354513,2020-03-08,Nous n’avons eu la chance de voir l’hôte qu’une seule fois mais elle fut charmante et respectueuse petit problème de communication tout de même entre ce qui se dit à la femme de ménage « Sheyla » et ce qui en revient à L’hôte.<br/>Beaucoup de bruit lorsque les occupants montent les escaliers ON entend TOUT.<br/>Il faut jetter le papier toilette dans la poubelle et non la toilette car ce-ci bouche les toilette paraît-il. <br/>A par ça <br/>Chambre lumineuse et spacieuse parfait pour une semaine à New-York.<br/>Emplacement parfait!
432204,15570322,2021-06-12,I spent 6 weeks at this Airbnb because it was close to my job. It is also close to the beach. Elvita was a great host and took care of everything that was needed. Being so close to the beach the parking was an issue for me but expected. Overall it was a good experience and would recommend this property because of the beach location.

770813,38000066,2019-10-19,"This apartment is in a great location. It is extremely quiet for NYC as it is at the back of the apartment building - which I really appreciated, having stayed in extremely loud locations in NYC before. I felt very safe there - and was on my own for a day or two before my colleague arrived. Public transport is close by and Central Park just a few minutes walk. Great restaurants nearby also. The apartment is spotlessly clean and beds are extremely comfortable. Shower and bathroom is excellent. Eduardo is very responsive - he came over a couple of times or responded by text very promptly. I would really like to give 5 stars but just can't quite do this - there were very few condiments, i.e. coffee or oil/vinegar and it was also very hot as the heating had been turned on, but it was not cold outside (mid- Oct). These things might not matter to some - but we were there for work and it did detract a little from our enjoyment of what is otherwise a superb listing, which I highly recommend to others."
681944,30236202,2021-03-22,"Gordon's place is exactly how the pictures displayed. I stayed for 3 nights so peaceful, quick responses. I will definitely be back. Close to transportation. local and shopping stores. I will definitely recommend Gordon's place."
672170,29635253,2019-12-05,"By far one of the best overall Airbnb experiences we’ve had. Location was very convenient to local public transportation. We rented a car for our east coast trip, and luckily we were able to find nearby street parking throughout the day, and night. Furthest we had to park was 2+ blocks away late at night since it’s a residential area. Zhen was an excellent host! She couldn’t have been anymore perfect. She easily accommodated to our date changes and any requests we had, and truly felt she went above and beyond to make sure we had a great stay. She listed local eateries and places nearby to check out, and was very thorough with any instructions necessary out on display. The place was immaculate and so beautiful! Perfect size for the 2 of us. The bed was firm, and I loved it! I normally hate every bed that’s not my own, and I was able to sleep peacefully every night we stayed in nyc. Bathroom and kitchen was fully stocked with anything we could need. Price was amazing! Definitely helped cut down on expenses on our trip, and such a great size for the price we paid. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting NYC and would recommend staying out of the city for convenience and suburbs. Would love to come back here next time I’m in town. Thanks again, Zhen!"

639567,27032162,2019-09-07,"The apartment is clean and spacious. However,  one of the beds was inflable and not confortable for an adult. <br/>There is no washing machine in the apartment but the host (who lives upstairs) can wash your clothes for an aditional fee (which is not cheap.) You will have also to pay an extra fee if you need to leave the luggage a couple hours after check out, even if you have stayed there for a long period.<br/>The apartment has good conection with the center:There's a Subway station 8 minutes away wich takes you to Wall street in 25 minutes. Nevertheless we suggest you to search the neighbourhood (brownsville) at (Hidden by Airbnb) and see if it fits you."

Only issue is that if you're tall like me, you'll be hitting your head on some pipes every now and then, but that wasn't enough to make me not enjoy the experience. Highly recommend!"
824512,44769471,2021-10-17,"I don't know about the negative reviews on here  but our stay for my family and I was anything but that. The way I see it, you have to make home wherever you go and thats what we did here. Titi was amazing to us! She was on top of anything we asked or mentioned and she even checked in on my daughter repeatedly after her major spinal surgery, which is why we there in NY.  This home was our home for 2 months when we needed it to be and it was just as you see in the pictures. Only the backyard was so much more beautiful and became our favorite spot eapecially at night with the gorgeous hanging over lights under the trees and down the back stairs, my daughters would sit and write or just listen to music and take in the New York air and sounds. Yes there was an a issue or 2 like a fan went out, nothing huge, but Titi was on it the next day! Tammys place was home to us and just GORGEOUS over-all! Thank you Tammy and Titi and I hope my review helps you decide to book this beautiful home. <br/><br/>I promised my 18 year old daughter we would come back here hopefully next summer when she fully recovers from her surgery and this is where we will definitely be staying again <3 <br/><br/>THANKS AGAIN FROM THE BOTTOM OF OUR HEARTS LADIES!! You seriously made our stay home for us :)"

Parking is very hard on this block even with the assigned parking spot because there was a big truck parked near by and Made it difficult to get into the spot. Nevertheless I was able to do so. <br/>Overall, the description was accurate and it was clean. I didn’t see any Spider webs in the corner, any small hair,dust, or stains on the sheets. It had what I needed and I would stay there again. The value is good for what you pay for and I recommend this place."

582440,22632338,2019-06-09,"Great apartment for staying and the host is fantastic! I cannot rave enough about her, but the next door neighbors were my biggest issue. They were loud and inconsiderate at night so we did not get any good night's sleep because of them. Otherwise they stay was great and the apartment was just as pictured!"
342830,10886971,2019-06-05,"Shakima has been a great host! <br/>The house is located in a very good position, well connected with every neighborhood of New York: A and C subway line and G one. <br/>You can find supermarkets walking only few minutes.<br/>The Laundromat is 2 mins on foot.<br/>The apartment is very clean and she really care a lot about this aspect. <br/>The room is very cosy, as the other common part of the house. The room is equipped with both fan and AC. <br/>Shakima is a very nice woman! <br/>I highly recommend you to book this home, for long stay as well."

Great communication though with the host, and had everything needed.  Staci was great to having the place available early after having issues with flights and landing too early in New York.  <br/><br/>Also note the futon is not comfortable, so take this place as two beds only.  But other than that, nice place to be and close to the bus stop so you can get around easily."
837906,46414136,2021-03-02,staying here was great! the view is amazing. staff and everyone was understanding and super helpful. it was easy to find transportation and there was a lot to do in the area. the room was also really clean and beautiful.

334073,10282307,2019-03-10,This apartment is really cute. It’s roomy for a New York space and accommodated our needs well. We loved the coffee and tea and other amenities. It was a little tricky with no elevator and an infant with our baggage being that it is on the third floor.
756150,36477307,2019-10-27,"Fantastic upstairs space! Great couches and several spaces to crash. Hosts were very gracious, helping accommodate our large group with linens, mattresses, and street parking."
689785,30905264,2019-02-07,Dana’s place was perfect for my stay. It is in a convenient location for night life but still out of the way. Everything was so close I really didn’t need me rental car.
675269,29855428,2020-09-18,"Great space, very clean, excellent value and exactly as described.  A little far from a subway station, but for the price you really can't beat it.  Melitza was very helpful and responsive.  You couldn't ask for a better host."
97448,1042806,2019-09-08,Linda's place is so lovely and clean! The location is so perfect! There's a bus stop just right beside the house and the frequency of the buses are so frequent.

372834,12972292,2019-08-03,Kamil was very responsive to our queries. The amenities were clean and we did enjoy the freedom of coming in and out with the private access to guest The location is very safe. Public transportation available with buses and the Metropolitan Station which is 20 mins walking distance and less by bus. It was easy to move to downtown and other places with the train and bus system.  I will strongly recommend this place. We will surely book this place again if we come to New York. Thanks Kamil!

66406,643948,2019-03-21,"If you’re looking for a clean, quiet, well organized and comfy place this is the place you should go for. <br/>I’d definitely come back and stay with Grace again. Unfortunately I couldn’t get to know her fantastic cooking skills due to the fact that I’ve been out all day long and returned quite late but I’m sure this would have been fantastic too. <br/>Subway stations are very easy to reach and nearby too. I felt safe walking around this area at any time.<br/>I hope I’ll be able to stay at her place again when I return to NYC some time in the future!"
611243,24756139,2019-09-25,"Could not say more than other travellers, everything was as expected - friendly host, nice room, good location (metro users). Minor inconvenience- slow wifi. Thank you for having us:)"

431959,15561163,2020-10-31,"Michelle is a lifesaver! I was in a pretty tough spot, needing to find a month-long stay with less than 24hrs. I'm so thankful I found Michelle; her response time is like no other. She's a straight shooter and great communicator. I appreciated her empathy for my situation. She went above and beyond to make me feel comfortable and at home. <br/><br/>The place is peaceful, cozy, quiet, sun-drenched and spacious. It was fully equipped with all the necessities and amenities for a longer stay. The cable was all inclusive and allowed for me to stay up-to-date on all my favorite shows. The kitchen was fully stocked with all the cookware you can imagine. Hand sanitizer and Lysol wipes were also provided. <br/><br/>Staying upstairs from Michelle made me feel like I was extended family. She was always there when needed, checked-in when necessary and had complete respect for my privacy. I would definitely recommend Michelle and her cozy spot to any and everyone; especially those looking for comfort."

234358,5897622,2019-08-04,Tom is very communicative and prompt. His instructions were very clear and the apartment worked out great. The only somewhat unexpected aspect is that cooking is not allowed even though there is a kitchen and appliances. But that was made clear prior to booking and did not end up being an issue.
748381,35573317,2021-01-18,"Beautiful space, comfy room. I would stay again!"

There is a great park near the spot. <br/><br/>The apartment is clean and very comfortable. It was a pleasure to stay and chill after my enormous walking tours.<br/><br/>Andy is an intelligent, friendly and helpful host. Any time happy to help with recommendations.  <br/><br/>So, I spend amazing days there. Thanks!"
843759,46985961,2021-05-26,The room had a really nice view.
714068,32940875,2019-03-14,"Stayed here two nights. Place is brand spanking new and clean. Amenities were as described, and communication was quick. Jackson heights is a nice neighborhood and it really is 30minutes to Manhattan.  Warning to super light sleeper: The walls are thin (and it’s a few rooms next to each other), plus the heating system, while not noisy, wirrs up every now and then. Would probably stay again given overall value."
889921,52633767,2021-11-06,"Absolutely awesome spot! Clean, great decorations, and amazing food at the restaurant! I lived 12 years in New York and did not know about this place - now I'm a huge fan and plan to stay there again before moving back to Manhattan next year."

760288,36948978,2019-09-30,"Nice appartment in Brooklyn, not far from a Subway station. It is clean and well decorate. The owner is nice and even we didn't meet at first at the check in, he made sure to greet us before leaving. :)"

482819,18022636,2020-12-05,"Maria's place is the quintessential Brooklyn experience. It is in a great location and has access to many wonderful places. I loved the ground floor apartment and the refinished bathroom was lovely. If peace and quiet are important to you in the mornings, this is not the place for you. There are very active young children on the 1st floor who create a consistent noise level for quite a while. If, however, that is not bothersome to you, then this really is such a quaint, sweet apartment. I know I will have some wonderful memories to look back on!"
341890,10807838,2021-08-22,He was a very accommodating person

716167,33155909,2019-08-05,inside: nice 1 bedroom apartment. this is her home so it has some childrens toys and a crib but they are not obtrusive to your stay tucked away. the futon in the living room was nice. full cooking items. the door system is a bit of a challenge you have to turn and push to open the door. extra deadbolt inside for safety.<br/><br/>around: hallways are nice clean. 5th floor but elevator works well its a bit old school.<br/><br/>outside: area is nice with brick rowhouses close to a nice school pretty to walk around campus.  2 blocks from stores and the sugar hill area. close to metro. i didnt have any issue with parking but it is off street parking.
584109,22770827,2021-09-18,"Thihshan was an excellent host, the house is very good located and is very near from subway. A few stations from time square and others main city atractions. Definetly i would stay again. the place is exactly as shown in the pictures."

171770,3512620,2019-05-25,"Lovely apartment with accommodation on two levels and everything you need in a self catering apartment. The area is fun - handy for food shops, bakeries and no distance to the subway (two stops within 10 minutes walk)"
772588,38186786,2021-09-03,"I had a great stay in the cozy, accommodating, & conveniently located home. I would definitely recommend!"
715168,33061311,2021-04-02,Shelley’s space is very special. It is in a charming building that still retains a lot of original architectural elements. The windows provide a lot of natural light and the space feels open and airy. The kitchen though small is well organized and highly functional. Located on a quiet tree lined block makes for the perfect escape while not being too disconnected from everything Bed-Stuy and NYC has to offer.
390028,13642019,2021-09-28,"This is a very comfortable, clean, modern and very well appointed basement unit (with a private entrance) that is totally new construction. It is larger and more comfortable than I expected and all of the details are taken care of. <br/>Communication with Ella was very easy and she was super responsive to any need or question we had. The neighborhood is perfect, on a quiet street just half a block from restaurants, shops, etc. I would definitely stay here again."
578485,22435019,2019-10-15,"Das Apartment ist in einem guten Zustand und die Küche ist hervorragend ausgestattet. Es war lediglich etwas hellhörig.

Wir würden die Unterkunft jederzeit wieder buchen."
825362,44804027,2021-07-08,"Merlene was a wonderful host. She communicated very quickly every time I messaged and was super helpful with all my queries. She also gave us a late check out for our evening flight. <br/>The location is ideal for the subway - just a block away - and there are good supermarkets, coffee shops, conveniences right  nearby. If you don’t mind the walk then straight down 3rd Ave takes you to the Upper East Side and all the many restaurants and museums there. It’s just a few blocks from Central Park and we loved starting our days with a run around the reservoir. <br/>The area around the apartment isn’t the cleanest. The streets have a lot of trash especially after the weekend. If you can look past this and are happy to stay somewhere “gritty” I would definitely recommend this apartment. The place was ideal for our family of 4 with 3 separate bedrooms, all decent sized. This meant we each had space and we’re not cramped. The kitchen had all appliances you could want. The access to washer & drier was much appreciated."
799558,41251479,2021-01-12,"We loved our stay at Marian’s place! All the shops were minutes away from us, train stop less than 10 minutes away, and the best part was that Prince street pizza was less than a 15 min walk!! Everything is so nearby it’s a perfect location. Check in is rather easy after your first time getting inside. There were 4 flights of stairs so it was definitely a good workout too lol. Marian was very attentive and kind as well. The room was so cute, plenty of space for my friend and I. Will definitely reconsider staying here in the future! :)"

758821,36813246,2019-12-31,"O apartamento é muito velho e mau cuidado. A cachorrinha faz cocô bem na porta de entrada. Não se assuste se pisar no cocô dela. Há baratas pela casa e o Uber não consegue encontrar o apartamento. O aquecedor só funciona quando ele quer. Se eu não tivesse levado cobertor de casa teria morrido de frio, pois várias noites o aquecedor não funcionou."

681600,30229561,2019-08-25,"Alexander was responsive and helpful throughout our stay. However, we did not have towels the first two days and had to use our clothes to dry off after showering. The room is a little smaller in person so space was tight with two people. Overall, I had a good experience staying at Alexander’s and would stay there again."
705743,32354513,2020-07-21,Great little spot in Bed Stuy <br/>Parking on the street was no issue. <br/>Everything in BK was 15 min away <br/>Great little spot. <br/>No complaints

309694,9184124,2020-09-06,Gorgeous & spacious place! He provided everything that I needed and more. He always responded back to me very fast! Would definitely recommend and stay here again.
746463,35454756,2019-06-21,"This apartment is absolutely lovely. I rented it for my family (Mum and Dad, Brother and his wife) and they really enjoyed the 2 independent bathrooms, super well equipped, the AC in every rooms, the equipment of the open kitchen and the stylish decoration. The wife is super fast and the apartment is located walking distance from the metro and buses to access Manhattan in less than 30min.<br/>On top of this the neighborhood is super calm, no noise and very safe. <br/>The view from the window on Manhattan skyline is great (on the left side :).<br/>I recommend strongly to all visitors who want a quite place close to Manhattan."
846371,47293809,2021-06-15,"What a wonderful find! From the spotless cleanliness, to all the thoughtful/insightful extras provided throughout the apartment (basic food stuffs in the kitchen, coffee, tea, even ice cream cones in the freezer?), this is a gem. Uri and Aliza couldn't be more hospitable and attentive. What a lovely set of hosts. And what a fun and lively neighborhood, with plenty of great character and tasty food within steps of the apartment. The subway is just around the corner (but you couldn't hear it), making it super convenient to travel into Manhattan and other points. Altogether our crew of four had nothing but compliments and gratitude for this Airbnb."
34299,208889,2020-02-26,Jameelah is nice and answered our questions. The apartment is around 8 minutes from the metro and had everything that we needed. The only problem is the bathroom and kitchen could be cleaner and the rooms were getting cold at night (we stayed in February) and we couldn't adjust the heating. Everything else was great.
872477,50329700,2021-06-21,"Great people, great place, quite environment,  and a really comfortable bad. I recommend this space for a stay!"
740531,35045823,2019-12-01,Loved the accuracy of the place. The room was very spacious and had some really cool furniture and decorations. The bed was beyond comfortable! Body pillow included. The mini fridge and microwave is a huge plus addition to the room. The sofas and table was good for my laptop space.<br/>There’s a bathroom down the hall which is easily accessible when you don’t need the main bathroom upstairs. The kitchen and bathtub are on the second floor of the house. It’s a nice quiet walk to the 2nd floor. Lots of privacy amongst other tenants. <br/>Check in was great! I was delayed and booked here last minute. The host waited up until I got there showed me around the place and got to have a quick chat. Very welcoming and hospitality is outstanding. <br/><br/>I recommend this stay
870683,50088561,2021-07-15,"There was a woman lying on the couch when I arrived who is there 24 hours a day. She sings loudly and watches TV on blast. She manages the kitchen in a way that makes it unavailable for guests to use any of the dishes. This is not suitable for guests who prefer to cook their own food, and I would not recommend this for a long term stay.<br/><br/>The bed is comfortable and the shower is clean and has hot water. It’s totally fine for a weekend, but not a place you can stay long term / work remotely / cook."
212019,4756578,2019-12-29,"Katrina's apartment is the perfect place if you want to experience New York atmosphere. <br/>Well located in a quiet area  , close to a lot of restaurants, not to far from midtown. <br/>Having the morning  coffee on the apartment's  terase, meanwhile watching Empire State Building is something you should experience."
773785,38328882,2019-11-02,"Clean space, modern decor, and easy check in process. The hosts responded quickly to messages sent and were able to answer my questions. Parking is on the street but was relatively easy to find before 7pm."

230501,5695523,2019-01-13,"We loved our stay at Irene's place! It was easy walking distance from the subway, which was perfect for us as we wanted to explore all over the city! It was also nice and quiet at night. We especially enjoyed the book of suggestions for things to do and places to eat- it was thoughtful and thorough. We tried out a few of the neighborhood restaurants suggested and loved them- especially Nana Ramen!"
456006,16613747,2019-12-25,"The room was very clean and comfortable. Jonathan is really kind and respectful. In the area there is lots of places for breakfasts and it is really easy to go to Manhattan, since the subway station is close to the apartment."
495492,18613981,2019-06-23,Abi's house is an amazing value! Located a fifteen minute bus ride away from the subway station. The house itself is very homey and Abi was a very friendly and welcoming host!
808739,42537367,2020-12-17,Fantastic!
504146,19069305,2021-08-19,"Was very satisfied with my stay here! The host, Yuval, is very nice and will help you out with everything! The location is very nice and safe, not too far from Manhattan and close to the subway station. Definitely a comfortable and affordable stay!"
791689,40371175,2021-09-02,"This mid-town loft was a great stay and my wife and I highly recommend it. Great location, very private once you get to the top of the stairs, and very comfortable. Fully appointed with everything you need. And more than anything, the hosts were responsive (only via the app) and honest. You’ll be glad you rented it."
74771,747538,2019-03-08,"Nick’s place is absolutely wonderful! It has a very welcoming feel to it, it’s filled with natural light and nicely decorated.<br/><br/>There’s plenty of space in the room and the bed is super comfortable!<br/><br/>Neala makes for an adorable little housemate, she’s the sweetest cat!<br/><br/>I’d stay here again in a heartbeat!"
167515,3325617,2021-08-13,Great location. Quiet neighborhood. We were able to find street parking. Plenty of stores near by and only a couple of minutes from the 7 train. We had trouble getting the key but Shawn came to help right away even though it was late in the evening. The whole place was clean as well.
435316,15733832,2019-04-22,nice ans clean appartement. friendly hosts good check in :)
752911,36115258,2021-08-08,"Apartment was clean and spacious. The building’s location right beside the subway tracks, and the entrance to the building were not ideal, but still a great unit for a great price."
850093,47774203,2021-03-06,"An outstanding place to stay. The host is very courteous and quick to respond to texts and emails. The apartment is conveniently located near many restaurants, shopping markets, and a laundry mat. The neighborhood is relatively safe. The apartment was very clean and well maintained. I really appreciated all the extra little amenities (dishes, utensils, coffee, etc.)  I have a wonderful stay and I would highly recommend this place."
502327,18993091,2019-09-28,Safe area. Super spacious. Clean. Probably the best host/airbnb i’ve stayed with so far.
474705,17609502,2019-11-08,"If you’re looking for a place to stay overnight for an early flight out of JFK, choose this without hesitation. Only 10 minutes or so from the airport, plenty of parking nearby, and a very comfortable room/bed to sleep in. Kevin is a very responsive and accommodating host as well, I highly recommend anybody to stay here."
570830,22122470,2019-09-07,"Wir haben uns in der Wohnung von Mukaram3sehr wohl gefühlt. Der Preis für New York war unschlagbar für uns. Lediglich ist die Umgebung in Harlem etwas gewöhnungsbedürftig. Mädels sollten abends nicht alleine herausgehen. Die Anbindung an die subway ist super. Nur 5min Fußweg zur Station. Auch ein Supermarkt, der 24h geöffnet hat, war nur eine Straße weiter. In allem war das für uns die perfekte Unterkunft für diese Woche."
595037,23612811,2021-07-18,Issac was accommodating from the beginning by allowing us to arrive in the middle of the night. The apartment was clean and the room was very comfortable. Close to everything. I'd definitely rent here again!

368726,12711153,2021-02-10,Shirley’s dad is super cool; he really went above and beyond and even offered to do my laundry since I was busy juggling in between school/work/externship and my car breaking down. <br/><br/>My stay was truly that pleasant - that I even extended the visit  thank you
480437,17856672,2020-02-03,"Todo excelente, solo un pequeño inconveniente con la calefacción esperamos pronto lo arreglen !"

673316,29705049,2019-05-09,I liked Linda's apartment. Very good location and price. 10 minutes to the nearest metro station and about 50 minutes to Times Square. For one person this is the perfect apartment. There is a stove and all for cooking. Very tasty and not expensive restaurant Peaches near the house (5 min)
628655,26055709,2019-09-28,"Great value! We appreciated being able to stay in Brooklyn for a fraction of what a hotel would cost, or even most other Airbnb's. Thanks for a cozy and comfortable stay!"
151407,2620837,2021-02-12,"I stayed here for over a month and really enjoyed it. The loft is very spacious, high ceiling, lots of sunlight.. truly amazing place. I have a whole big private room for myself where I can sleep and work comfortably. People here also take good precautions for covid and there’s plenty room to keep distance from each other. We have shared bathrooms and kitchen and they are kept clean. Mark and other tenants were very friendly and nice, really made me feel at home although it was a short stay. I definitely would love to come back here when I’m in Bushwick."
337678,10498577,2019-09-30,The room was great as presented on the website. Really close from the subway and not so far from the city.
655891,28366610,2019-10-14,"The House was very clean, the bed was little uncomfortable but manageable, overall it was as expected and communication was great, thank you Raj."
834800,46088307,2021-06-25,If you’re not familiar with New York transportation do some research before you book. Ride shares are expensive & long.
705379,32302978,2019-05-27,Nice place and convenient location. Alison was very helpful.
537927,20761404,2021-08-23,"Nice place, great area! A bit pricey, but overall amenities, rooftop, and room matched the pictures. I stayed for 31 days alone and was comfortable with no issues."

312159,9355498,2019-06-25,"A wonderful stay in a well located, well appointed space. The brownstone is beautiful and historic and the neighbourhood feels just the way I imagined Brooklyn to be. <br/>The space is second to none. The bedrooms are a good size, and the place is sparkling clean. We loved the rainforest shower in the bathroom. <br/>Richelle and Pela looked after us by helping us find parking and carrying luggage and so on. They are just the best, and I can’t wait to stay at their place again next time I’m in the city."

711704,32819286,2021-10-10,"I enjoyed my stay here with Cookie and Ronald. It was clean, cozy and close to everything you needed. <br/><br/>having the train only two blocks away from you was amazing. You have the best Jamaican food within walking distance and a deli that makes the best chopped cheese. <br/><br/>This was my first private room stay and my experience went well. Everyone else was super quiet, clean and considerate. <br/><br/>If you need a place technically to just sleep and shower and want to be away from the craziness of the city I recommend their place!"

The 24hr corner store was so convenient, and check in was a breeze! Despite being out of the country, Ness made me feel like I could reach her anytime I needed, and it’s clear that she really wants you to have a great experience. The subway is also an easy three blocks away. I’d definitely recommend this home to anyone staying in brooklyn. Thanks for everything Ness!"

756431,36533065,2019-10-02,"Nice stay. The subway station was only two blocks away so I was very pleased. The room was a lot bigger than I had expected, I did have some trouble opening the front door but I figured it out eventually. It’s a great place to stay if you plan on only sleeping there."
518407,19769912,2019-04-05,Highly recommended. The area is quite and easy access to transportation. The home was beautiful and the hosts were great.
181933,3802218,2019-12-15,"We had a great stay at chandras! Communication was easy, felt very welcome. Chandra thought of everything. Location was not in the centre but only steps from the subway. Easy to get the number 6 into the centre, they frequently come and are easy to navigate. 100% would return and recommend to family and friends."
440981,15928635,2019-05-01,"Dylana has been really helpful with me and the place was as good as i was expected, even better!  The   neighborhood is just awesome, close to super cool bar, restaurants, shops and 5 minutes walk from the subway.  The place was super clean and the room very confortable.  Be aware the subway could be noisy at night but it is not the kinda things that would bother me.  I would highly recommend it."
854132,48276918,2021-10-18,"I enjoyed staying at Mario’s apartment. It’s a good place to relax and chill after a day of exploring. This is a perfect place for a solo traveler. It is very close to get to the train station and there were a lot of local fruit vendors and food places. Mario is very accommodating. Response time is a little late, but I think that’s more of a problem on the app. Overall this is a good spot if you don’t want to explore outside of the Manhattan bubble and get it to know Brooklyn."

His home is a gem in the Bronx and you won’t regret booking his place. I will also point out having parking  space truly makes the stay even more relaxing. The neighborhood is quite and peaceful.

343099,10939710,2019-08-27,If your planning on visiting New York City this has to be one of the best air Bnbs you can stay at. About a 30 second walk to the M line in a neighbourhood that has a lot of nice small coffee shops and restaurants. Our hosts were amazing from the moment we checked in. They gave  us tons of suggestions for things to check out in in city and the best ways to get around. Place was beautiful and felt comfortable safe during the entire trip. My best air bnb experience thus far and it was large in part to the hosts. When I am back visiting NYC I will be trying to book in with them again!!
167454,3325617,2019-01-03,"Great Location about a 12 min. walk to the subway and a 7 min. walk to the Train. Clean space, good size bathroom and kitchen with all you could need. There are stairs leading to the room and three doors to unlock before you are in. There is no noise and the neighborhood felt safe.  There are great places to eat, grocery stores and a Chase bank all within  a 7 min. walk.  Uber into Times Square was about $15."
722781,33830012,2020-09-07,Please be aware you will not have a door you can close and lock to your space. He has hung a vertical blind and screen to the entrance. The people renting above you can access your space at any time. We did not feel safe and secure with our kids sleeping there and had to leave. He wouldn’t refund. When we called to tell him he got very angry and hung up on me.<br/><br/>He was still cleaning with his brother when we arrived and wasn’t wearing a mask or distancing from us. We were wearing masks. <br/><br/>He asked me to feed his fish and frog and take his laundry out of the drier and “shove it anywhere”. The place itself is large but cluttered with his personal belongings. His brother told me to make sure no one touched his records. There was a ton of garbage on the landing.<br/><br/>Very bizarre and disappointing experience. Would not recommend.
647829,27731269,2019-05-12,"Ospiti eccezionali! Sempre disponibili a qualsiasi necessità, problema o informazione. <br/>Casa veramente carina, pulitissima e ben organizzata.

Igualmente a pesar que era compartido nos sentimos en privado ya que durante el tiempo que estábamos allí casi nunca había Nadie. Lo único por mejorar es el olor al ingresar al ascensor y  las moscas que se generan."
845151,47162719,2021-11-08,Nice little place to stay if you're in NY for a short stay. Chewie replies laser fast so communication was really easy. The check in process was simple.

I Wish We Could Post Photo Reviews, But I Will Copy And Paste Our Text Convo. Host Made Our Stay Uncomfortable. Upon Arriving We Immediately Noticed The Half Done Cleaning Job That Was Said To Be Done . BIGGEST ISSUE We Found A USED CONDOM In The Couch Stove Top Was Dirty , Fridge Had Juice Stains And Smudges , Bed Sheets Had Stains (Nothing MAJOR 1 Here And There) But Still Noticeable. Bring Your Own Towels , They Are Cheap And Don’t Get You Dry. Apparently There Are Tenants Who Live Below (Which My Female Friend And I Believe Is Actually The Host Cant Confirm Just Our Theory) Who Complained About Noise. But Yet We Had To Listen To Them Speak Spanish Loudly Throughout The Day / Night. The Television Volume Was on Level 14) The Host Texted My Number AND Inboxed Me To Lower The Music Which We Did , But Also Rudely & Falsely Accused, Us Of Having More Than The Two Of Us There And Threatened To Cancel Our Stay . I Politely Told Him We Adjusted The Volume And Assured Him There Were No Extra Guests & Said He Could Come Check If He Wished , I Stated That We Found A Used Condom In The Couch And Tried To Call Him If He Needed To Speak. He Refused My Call And Just Said “I Cant Talk Right Now “ Never Addressing The Condom We Found . At Some Point Late That Night (After 4 Am) While We Were SLEEPING It Sounded Like Someone Had Exited The Residence  (You Can Hear The Keypad ) But We Cant Say For Sure But We Believe Someone Came To “Check That There Were Only Two Of Us”  The Heating And Cooling System Isn’t Central (Kept The Living Room Warm Only) So We Were Cold At Night And The “Comforters” Were Thin . Other Than That Its Spacious . <br/><br/>Host: Please lower the noise my tenant has to work it's late <br/><br/>Host: And there only suppose to be two quests you breaking house rules <br/><br/>Me: Music is down and its only two of us u can check nd we found a used condom on the couch if u would like to speak u can call my number (Calls Number)<br/><br/>Host: I cant speak right now <br/><br/>Me: Oh ok then have a goood nite<br/><br/>Host: Please thank you <br/><br/><br/>Next Day <br/>Host: Good afternoon everything ok <br/><br/>Me: Everything is fine<br/><br/>Host: Ok great"

108711,1294973,2019-03-28,"Todo bien, la ubicación cerca de la parada de la calle 96 hacía que llegar y volver desde el centro fuera muy rápido.<br/>Cama y habitación cómodas (bastante silenciosa excepto un pequeño golpeteo molesto por las noches, no conseguimos identificar su origen), buen baño y cocina, solo se echaba de menos una mesa en la que poder desayunar.<br/>Por poner un punto negativo, era un poco molesto tener que andar con cuidado para evitar a los vecinos y hacer la entrada y salida con el anfitrión llevando las maletas y nosotros yendo después, ya que parece que hay problemas si ven que se está alquilando una habitación en el edificio."
366271,12558745,2021-09-16,I really enjoyed my stay here the house was very communicative and check in and check out were easy. the host was very helpful after I arrived and the room was good size. really like the area and I would definitely recommend a stay at Joyell's

500102,18877341,2019-06-12,I would definitely stay here again. The private roof top is a major plus and the apartment was very comfortable and clean with all the amenities you could need.

404330,14222252,2019-11-18,"The location is in the less expensive neighborhood at the border of Wash Heights and Inwood, near the enbtrance to Ft Tryon Park (Cloisters) and the fast-to-downtown A train. Supermarkets and ethnic restaurants are nearby. It's very safe. The apt is best for one person, or two people who respect each other's space. It's a studio. It has all you coul want. The hosts were super-communicative. My only complaint is that the internet is super slow, 3-5 mbps. Owner needs to upgrade. But if you dont care about internet,, you can watch TV, Netflix, etc. I would stay there again"
787065,39782131,2019-12-16,Such a great spot! Great location. It was amazing.

I had a bathroom all to myself with shampoo and conditioner. <br/><br/>The apartment is in a great area in Soho, I could really walk everywhere and some amazing restaurants all around. <br/><br/>Ady was a great host, very friendly and welcoming. I would highly recommend staying here and would stay here again myself."
773560,38301886,2020-03-03,"The space was cozy and clean. The noise level of other guests was a bit of an issue at night, one that was not addressed by the hosts. But otherwise the stay was pleasant."
602334,24057583,2019-05-05,Friday was great! I wasn't able to get there until very late but he was still available for contact and I had no issues whatsoever. It was just what I needed to crash for the night. Clean and comfortable. Would definitely stay there again.
412181,14685276,2019-07-08,Spacious and beautiful place. Host Jorge had also been very responsive throughout to whole trip with clear instructions and communication.
854334,48297857,2021-10-18,"All rooms are not as spacious as they claim and if you encounter the smaller ones, you are still charged the same price as the bigger ones. It wasn't fair at all and too expensive for no reason!!"

748187,35545650,2021-06-29,"My friend and I came to NYC for a 4 day stay of sight seeing. The Chelsea Inn was reasonably priced for the area and we really enjoyed our stay. Check in was simple: I would’ve liked to receive my check in info a few days sooner, but I was given a unique check in code so no room key needed. Entry to the front door was also by code, much easier than keys! No doorman or any staff on site for Covid reasons but host answered the phone and messages promptly. Room was small but work well for our purposes. We had a bunk bed with comfortable mattresses. TV and wardrobe with a safe available, very nice glass shower. The noise level was slightly loud for my liking with other guests closing doors and a loud restaurant right behind/next to the Inn. I would recommend bringing a noise machine or the host to provide one for guests. Parking is free on 17th after 6pm on weekdays and free on weekends, so that was pretty simple. Weekdays during the day you’ll have to park elsewhere because 17th is for commercial vehicles only. There is a trash bin in the lobby for your daily trash. Super centrally located to the subway station in Union Square, tons of shops on 5th, perfect location. Highly recommend and will return!"
754073,36236515,2021-09-25,"Thanks Sharon for hosting. The place was clean, and comfortable , and good shower too"

716152,33155909,2019-04-25,Eine wunderschöne Wohnung in toller Lage. Die Gegend ist absolut sicher und die Nachbarschaft sehr freundlich. Die Fahrt mit dem A-train nach Downtown Manhatten ist nur 20 Minuten lang. Inna war immer zu erreichen und hat uns tolle Insider-Tipps gegeben über NY. Wir haben uns sofort zuhause gefühlt. <br/>A beautiful apartment in a wonderfull location. The area is absolutely safe and the neighborhood very friendly. The A-train ride to downtown Manhattan is only 20 minutes. Inna was always accessible and gave us great insidertips about NY. We felt home immediately.

709207,32618640,2020-06-11,"If I could give Aminul's place 10 stars I could. This place was amazing. The room felt like home. I'd initially only planned to stay for a month but ended up staying almost 3 months. The room is spacious, comfortable, and beautiful. The entire home has all the modern touches that make it a true standout experience. The common areas were cleaned on a regular basis and all the amenities were great. Especially the deck! I highly recommend this place."
371432,12856992,2019-08-24,"Would not recommend. Ugur is great, seems nice never met him as he was only available over text. Responsive nonetheless, roommate however is horrible, rude and intimidating. Banging on the bathroom door in the morning and shouting to hurry up when I was showering for no more than 5 mins.<br/><br/>Avoided staying there most of the 2 weeks by staying on a friends couch, didn’t want to bring it to the hosts attention as I just wanted to get out. <br/><br/>I use Airbnb a lot and this is most uncomfortable Ive been. Ever. It may seem cheap but there’s a reason. Spend the extra couple of bucks and go somewhere you will feel comfortable and enjoy."
199708,4359756,2019-08-31,Thank you for your support and effort
409811,14507274,2019-08-06,"What an amazing host, location and overall experience! We loved living as locals. Margo is incredibly kind and generous and her place is absolutely lovely (her books are just out of this world amazing). We'd love to come back!"
784794,39556412,2019-11-29,"I'll start with the positives. The apartment is clean and bright, and located in a quiet, lovely neighborhood near Carl Schurz park and lots of great restaurants. Comfortable bed, and good pressure in the shower. A management company takes care of the details, so communication is relatively good. Now for the downsides. The apartment itself is not very quiet. The walls are so thin you can hear people in the neighboring apartments, both from the living room and the bedroom. One could remedy this issue by being out in NYC all day and using ear plugs at night. Another issue was that ""hotel-style amenities"" were offered in the listing but not provided. This was Rishi's first time hosting, so it's possible he forgot them. But he really should have cleared his stuff out of the closets. There was no space to store our clothes and luggage, and no hooks for coats or other items. Ultimately our biggest issue with the apartment was building security. Next time we will book a place with a doorman."
839267,46528305,2021-07-20,"Excellent hotel and room, so clean and quiet. The staff was really helpful and the costumer service was excellent!"
576828,22376093,2019-07-14,"Ara is an amazing host. Communicative, accommodating, and kind. The place was spotless and decorated very well. Bed was comfy and the window AC unit worked like a charm. (We visited in July so really appreciated the cool air). This place is convenient to everything and steps from the subway. We’ll stay again!"
755941,36455649,2019-08-25,"The location for us was perfect. It was really close to the train station that takes you straight into Manhattan. Was also close to the JFK which was handy to us. The place itself had a hostel vibe. There was a musty odour which wasn’t pleasant. Once we left we noticed that our suitcases and all of our clothes smelt of the same odour so we had to rewash everything at our next Airbnb. The bathroom and kitchen were not the cleanest but this could be because of the amount of people using it throughout our stay, there were flakes of paint throughout the bathroom as well which would cling to everything. This room was very small so I probably wouldn’t recommend 2 people sharing it if you have large suitcases like we did, there wasn’t any room to have both suitcases opened at the same time unless you put it on the bed. We noticed the other rooms were larger so if they’re available they might be more accommodating! The bed was comfy and the bedding was clean. Communication from David was amazing and John was also incredibly friendly."
691003,31053180,2019-12-05,"Mein Aufenthalt in dieser Wohnung war mein erster Airbnb Aufenthalt überhaupt. Und ich muss sagen - meine Erwartungen wurden definitiv übertroffen! <br/>Zunächst zur Ausstattung: Die Wohnung sah - was ich sehr wichtig finde - genau so aus wie auf den Bildern. Die zwei Schlafzimmer waren schön groß, jeweils mit einem bequemen Doppelbett, Nachttischen, Schreibtisch, Kleiderschrank und großem Fernseher ausgestattet, sodass man bequem sein Gepäck ausbreiten und sich trotzdem noch frei bewegen konnte. Die Küche ist eine offene Küche, die nahtlos in den Wohnbereich mit Esstisch und Sofa übergeht. In der Küche sind alle wichtigen Geräte (Waserkocher, Kaffeemaschine, Mikrowelle, etc.) vorhanden und Alex war so nett, bereits einen Grundvorrat an Milch, Gewürzen, Tee und Kaffee da zu haben. Das Bad ist mit Wanne mit Duschvorhang, Spiegelschrank und Regal ausgestattet, sodass man alle seine Badartikel unterbringen kann. Was ich sehr bemerkenswert fand: Es waren bereits diverse Hygieneartilel (Duschgel, Sanityzer, Seife etc.) vorhanden. Auch ein Fön ist vorhanden.<br/><br/>Besonders toll fand ich die Kommunikation mit Alex: Bereits vor der Buchung hatte ich Alex mit mehreren Fragen kontaktiert, und ich habe jedes Mal innerhalb weniger Minuten Antworten erhalten. Auch nach der Buchung waren wir in Kontakt zwecks Anreise, wo Alex uns super erklärt hat wie wir vom Flughafen zur Wohnung gelangen und wir wir reinkommen (es gibt ein Keypad an der Haustür, wo ein Code eingegeben werden muss). Als wir an der Wohnung ankamen hat Alex uns bereits in der Wohnung erwartet. Er hat uns super freundlich empfangen  und alles in der Wohnung gezeigt und erklärt. Danach war er sogar so lieb und hat uns (nachdem wir uns innerhalb von 5 Minuten kurz frisch gemacht hatten) direkt mit dem Auto nach Manhattan mitgenommen. Wir konnten ihn während des gesamten Aufenthaltes immer kontaktieren, zum Beispiel um Tipps zu guten Restaurant o.ä. zu bekommen. Bei der Ankunft hat er uns direkt eine ganze Liste gemacht :-) besonders sein Tipp mit dem Brunch Restaurant in Brooklyn war toll!  <br/><br/>Alles in allem eine wirklich schöne Wohnung die super ans Metronetz angebunden ist (5Min zu Fuß zur nächsten Haltestelle)  aber trotzdem sehr ruhig liegt. Die Gegend ist eine normale Wohngegend, die auf uns einen sehr sicheren Eindruck gemacht hat. Es war toll nach einem anstrengenden Tag in Manhattan innerhalb von 10 Minuten zurück ‚nach Hause‘ im ruhigeren Brooklyn zu kommen und entspannt schlafen zu können. <br/><br/>Danke Alex für die die tolle Gastfreundschaft! :-) <br/>Thanks Alex for the great hospitality! :-)"

The room was as clean as a whistle and the rest of the apartment was nice with interesting art and stylish touches. Deonisis was helpful in many ways and definitely improved the quality of our vacation with his tips, directions and special amenities.

The apartment had a rustic, historic feel but with modern amenities which was very nice. Internet was lightning fast, good water pressure, and the air conditioner was great after a long day outside. Hardly any street noise at night. Only issue was the bathroom had an occasional weird odor. I mentioned it to the house keeper and was told to just keep tabs on it. It faded some after a while and never reached any other part of the apartment. I was out in the city much of my stay so it wasn’t a huge issue, but I do hope gets fixed. Other than that I had a great stay. Thank you Gaia & Pietro :)"

Some negatives: the street location isn't great, wifi doesn't reach the room, older building, noisy street-side. Also the host office hours are 9-6 but they were rarely there before 11 making it real tough to get clean towels."

732519,34313601,2020-01-18,"Kevin and Karen’s apartment is in a great Brooklyn location, very close to Prospect Park, on a quiet residential street. The apartment is well appointed, comfortable and spacious. The only downside is that each morning we were awakened by noise from the family living above the apartment (around 6:30 am eastern time during two weekday mornings and 7:45 am on Saturday). Just them walking around reverberated down into the bedroom, so if you’re a light sleeper this will be an issue. For a late checkout we were asked to pay $75, but we decided against it."

She was super helpful with tips on getting around the city and what to do. <br/>The location is right by the Q which was convenient for getting into Manhattan. The surrounding neighborhood isn’t super nice BUT I never once felt unsafe. There are also cute coffee shops scattered throughout if you keep going down Flatbush. The bedroom and bathroom were VERY clean. The bed was comfy and the entire apartment was cozy. It completely exceeded my expectations. I’ll definitely be staying here again.
808784,42537367,2021-10-04,"Clean, accurate, cozy and close to everything. This is a perfect place to spend a couple of days in the city. Literally 5 minute walking from the subway and even a supermarket around the corner of you like doing groceries for your stay. Cannot recommend it enough."

Sarah et Andrews nous ont très bien accueillis et Sarah répondait rapidement à toutes nos questions.<br/>Notez juste que la salle de bain privée se trouve dans le salon/ cuisine et qu’elle n’est pas attenante à la chambre. De plus pour les personnes habituées à dormir dans le noir total, sachez qu’il n’y a pas de volet ou de rideau occultant et que vous serez réveillés au lever du jour (ce qui n’est pas plus mal pour profiter d’une journée complète à New York), sinon optez pour un masque pour dormir comme nous l’avons fait ;) Le lit est confortable mais un peu étroit pour 2 personnes car il penche des 2 côtés (le sommier étant plus petit que le matelas).<br/>Williamsburg et le quartier animé se trouve seulement à quelques bloques. Nous avons beaucoup apprécié notre séjour."

There’s a small supermarket across the street and parking on the street if you’re driving.

495339,18609316,2019-11-09,"It was just an amazing stay, for more than one month. It was my first time on Airbnb and I was a little bit afraid, but it was just fantastic. Diane and Toby are amazing, always available, ready to answer your questions, and they always make you feel home. The room is very nice and clean, and the bathroom is shared with only another guest. The location is nice, 20 minutes walk from Columbia University and very close to lines red and green of the subway (max. 10 minutes walk); this makes very easy going downtown whenever you wish. If I come back to NY, I would like for sure to stay in this house again."

410553,14609804,2021-07-31,"Jamie was very responsive to our messages. We had weird flights schedules so our check in and check out time was not very ideal, but he went extra miles to help us accommodate. The house itself is very well equipped with everything we need (iron, hair drying, etc). It is one block away to a subway station and a lot of the interesting spots are in walking distance (the Vessel, art galleries in Chelsea, K town, etc). Highly recommend this place!"

Lorna was very thoughtful, supplying juice, coffee and breakfast supplies, as well as a blanket when the temperature dropped during out stay. The location was incredibly convenient, a block away from a train stop, coffee shops, and great bars. The inside was clean, comfortable, and quiet with plenty of natural light (so bring an eye mask if you're sensitive). I would definitely stay again."

The apartment is located in an extremely convenient location within a 3 minute walk to the subway and a 5-10 minute walk to some of the best restaurant, bars and coffee shops in Brooklyn and the city in general.  There are also tons of events (like smorgasburg, a weekly food festival) and a lot of great parks within walking distance for those with children.  the apartment itself is very well designed and uses space well.  it has a master bedroom, a small bedroom with a very comfortable pull out couch and a kitchen and living room with all these spaces separated by doors.

309695,9184124,2020-10-11,"Yemi deserves the best airbnb host award. The house was pristine clean, the fridge had some awesome goodies that truly made all the difference since grocery shopping was the last thing I wanted to do, what a nice surprise. The cabinets are also fully stocked even tons of spices, oil, anything you may need if you like to cook. Keyless entry at the back of the house so very private and safe. The washer and drier were so convenient since I rented the place while rotating at a nearby hospital so I could wash my scrubs often. Walk to Brookdale Hospital was about 15 minutes and uber <5 minutes (not the best neighborhood but I never felt unsafe as I just made sure to uber if it was too late at night). <br/>Overall loved the place and the host(although I never met him in person). Truly appreciate all the nice touches, it felt like home for the month was there."

736545,34620162,2021-09-27,This place was a great stay! Not as clean as we expected but overall we loved the place! Would stay here again 10/10 because the location was super close to a bus stop that connects to the transfer stations. Which makes it a super convenient stay! You get your own private entrance in a little home with everything you need plus goodies. Really gave us a glimpse at what it’s like being a local in New York!
827747,45203962,2021-09-01,"Great location with amazing charm. The place was spotless. It should be noted however that there is  no AC in the second bed room and it’s not a true two bedroom apt, it a 1bd apt with a separate bed, locking bedroom in the hallway. Nice place overall."
439447,15844782,2019-11-07,"Tanya and Sanjay's apartment is excellent, and I would have no hesitation in recommending both the apartment, and the hosts, to future travellers. Communication before my stay was clear and timely, and Tanya was very helpful in accomodating some unusual check in requirements. The location is excellent, within walking distance of 15th Street / Prospect Park subway stop on the F / G line. Plenty of local shops and amenities in the Windsor Terrace area, and excellent access to the wonderful Prospect Park."

La sera preferivano prendere il taxi visto che alcune zone limitrofe non sembravano molto sicure, ma comunque non abbiamo mai avuto problemi e la gente del quartiere era gentile e disponibile(quasi tutti ci auguravano il buongiorno incroconadoci la mattina) . Sidney é stato molto gentile a ppermetterci il check in anticipato. Complessivamente soddisfatti."

512955,19528326,2019-03-24,"It's an average NYC apartment in Gramercy, so don't expect it to be super fancy or new. However, it's on a quiet street and close to everything. The apartment itself is decent size. The only complaint I really had was the the bathroom light switch doesn't work well, and I had to turn the switch multiple times to turn it on. Checking in and out was easy as well. Overall, it's a good deal, if you want a place by yourselves, because for this price in similar location, a hotel room smaller than this apartment would cost way more."

790355,40158014,2020-01-03,"My stay at Peter’s apartment was wonderful! His place is very authentic, far from the typical Ikea apartment, and the room was cozy and tidy. The house has amazing amenities overall, with great attention to detail, and both the bathroom and the kitchen were very clean (FYI - I am very picky about bathrooms and this one passed my test). The apartment is only a few blocks from the subway, which is very convenient, and the area is quiet and safe.<br/>Peter makes you feel like home from the moment you get there. He is very gentle, polite and knowledgeable, and an extremely interesting person. He helped me with everything I needed during my stay and even invited me join him to go to a concert in a nearby bar called Lunatico.<br/>The time that I have spent by Peter has been fabulous. I will recommend Peter’s place to my friends visiting New York and I will surely come back myself in my future visits to the city."

I would really recommend to go for it!! :)"

445409,16201959,2021-09-17,"Kv was a great host and very communicative. The check-in was a breeze and the location was fantastic! The kitchen, living room, and backyard are absolutely beautiful and a pleasure to be in. As mentioned in the listing,  there isn't an AC unit upstairs, which is something to consider in the warmer months. Since this is a ground unit, the downstairs bedroom and office space don't get a ton of natural light but it has an AC unit so it stays nice and cool. Would absolutely recommend this spot!"
850822,47866275,2021-07-25,"Beautiful space with fantastic lighting and a great little desk to work from. I absolutely fell in love with the neighborhood and would definitely return!! Hristiyan is the perfect host with wonderful communication.<br/><br/>The bed was firm but comfortable. I would bring my own pillow next time for longer stays. <br/><br/>I would like to highlight the “shared entrance” though, because I didn’t understand before I arrived. A wooden room divider and floor-to-ceiling curtains are all that separates this apartment from the entrance door (which is also used for the downstairs space). It wasn’t a problem for me, but I think it’s accurate to say this space is private,  but not secure from downstairs guests. I would still return!"

606501,24380794,2021-07-28,"Artem was great about communicating with us and getting us a refund. We had a few concerns when we got to the apartment.  We didn’t realize it was on the second floor and getting luggage up was a hassle. Also, the second bedroom didn’t have a window or air conditioning (we asked Artem if she could bring fan and she said she would).  The apartment was a bit run down more than it seemed in the pictures but it was clean and safe.  When we turned on the AC in the main living area, there was a smell of wood smoke (which can give me migraines). After messaging with Artem about the fan and AC, she offered a full refund and we accepted. The apartment was close to some fun places and the subway was close and convenient."

691354,31059670,2021-09-16,"Had a great stay at Zeta’s. Everything was clean and well equipped. She gave nice towels and bedding. The bed was comfortable. The internet was not super fast when we were there but Zeta immediately helped find a solution that worked great for remote working. The area has some great restaurants, bodegas and coffee shops and it’s only 3 blocks from the M or F train. Despite being close to the tracks the apartment was very quiet. The backyard was nice, my boyfriend even worked out in it a few times. All in all we would stay again. Great NYC crash pad."
663705,28938342,2021-05-28,"A gem of a place! It was very clean, nice amenities, easy check in directions - just an overall excellent stay. Quick walk to the subway that takes you right into the city. Would highly recommend as a solo traveler!"
299514,8704528,2019-04-29,"A practically perfect stay. This was my first time using Airbnb, so I was unsure what to expect, but Marjorie was a wonderful host and made me feel very comfortable in her home. The space is beautiful, very clean and tastefully decorated, and the room gets lots of natural light especially in the morning. Marjorie had great tips on places to eat and ways to get around the city. Importantly though she also gave me plenty of privacy and was unphased when I came back very late at night. I’d definitely want to stay here again. The only negative is to get to Manhattan you have to either take a bus and then a train, or take the ferry, which only runs once or twice an hour. Overall though, this place is great, and I’d recommend it highly."
872931,50383126,2021-07-25,My girlfriend and I had an excellent time! Great space and location. Carlos was a great host.
286273,8219648,2019-12-21,This is my second time staying with Chester and it was even better than the first time. The place is clean and spacious and Chester is great and easy to communicate with.
814325,43161885,2020-07-23,This space is exactly as pictured: stylish and clean!! Melissa was a great host answering all my questions immediately. It was the perfect night away to relax and enjoy a quick staycation.  Melissa always helped me retrieve something I forgot in the space! I deforest recommend this place to anyone.
327127,10019312,2019-11-11,"Such a beautiful home with a comfortable, clean, and spacious room. Shower pressure is amazing! Son was only there/awake for a few hours but does have high energy. Neighborhood felt safe and kid friendly. There are paid parking garages adjacent to the building. There is a valet guy there 24/7 and it’s very safe. <br/>I hope to stay again as they were very comfortable greeting my boyfriend and I, and made us feel welcome!"
878548,51000579,2021-09-26,good location and great place very pleasant
700598,31839994,2020-03-09,"Nice private house next to a park in a quiet neighborhood! Loved the area, lots of good places to eat and a convenient store is just around the corner. Would love to stay here again!"
361209,12307809,2019-10-20,"Great place for a small family or a couple. Pharmacy, supermarket, local bars, delis, subway stations and even one of the most precious parks that I ever seen are really near. The apartment floor and the stairs (to get to the apartment) are made from wood so expect the classic squeaky noises. All the apartment was clean and in order, the kitchen was really nice (which will help you to save some money so you can spend it on more activities in the city), the TV will only have access to the standard online streaming services thou.<br/>I enjoyed the stay there and I recommend it for knowing the Big Apple without spending all your savings in hotels or have terrible hostal experiences."
353518,11659242,2019-03-18,This was a great value! The area is a lot of fun and you can walk to nearly anything. George was quick to communicate and assist us with any needs.
862724,49380595,2021-09-27,its a great area love the restaurants in the area.<br/>place is very clean
217847,4968633,2019-06-14,"Leecia was warm and welcoming and had helpful suggestions. Her place was very cute and homey, and there were two subway stations a few blocks away. I liked the structure of this studio—not too small and not too big—perfect for a couple. I also appreciated that we had AC and a fan, and yes, the tap water really was great. As far as the area goes, it was not my favorite, but that could just be my personal preference. In retrospect I would have preferred staying in a more populated area with heavier foot traffic and more open businesses that would provide a variety of dining options. The streets here can get quiet in the later hours. I suggest researching what activities you’ll be doing and how far they are from where you’ll be staying. Uber is quite expensive out here, so unless you’re comfortable with walking down unfamiliar streets at night, I suggest you really consider distance and time."
613689,24916571,2021-10-03,Cecilia’s place was absolutely awesome. We went with our eight months old baby to spend the weekend in bk and we were very happy about how clean this place was. Spotless!  Location is amazing and the neighborhood is quite. We wanted to stay more days and def will be back.
777672,38751409,2021-07-05,This is a 6 bedroom. No convenient parking. The host was not easy to work with. No other property to accommodate. I was not happy with the apartments.
385906,13474455,2021-03-22,"You will not regret choosing Deirdre's place. It is perfect. so much character and she adds everything  you need.<br/>The neighborhood is wonderful, beautiful Bed-Stuy."
504138,19069305,2021-06-20,"We had a great stay at Yuval’s apartment. The apartment was really cozy, the room I felt was a little small but comfortable. We had no issues in checking in or out whatsoever. Situated at a very convenient location. Close to a lot of cafes and restaurants. This place was value for money."
100224,1089542,2019-09-04,I love kids. They are so talented. And their dad he's amazing
595749,23651443,2021-10-17,"This was one of the nicest apartments I've ever been in in New York. <br/><br/>It was clean, spacious, and in the perfect area - a short walk to the park and an even shorter walk to the best train lines in the city (the B/Q).<br/><br/>The hosts were friendly, super easy to communicate with, and very informative. I would absolutely recommend this location and I plan on trying to stay again next time I have a business trip in the city =)"

775253,38483301,2020-03-15,"She treats you like family from the second you walk in. Very relaxing and great time low key hanging out with the host watching Indian soap operas. She offers you tea, water, and food nonstop. Very close to Roosevelt ave, lots of great food especially phillipino and mexican."
178725,3738815,2021-08-15,Near Empire State Bldg and convenient location. No elevators.
865679,49571409,2021-11-07,Great location! Room was great. I was only there for one night but a longer stay would get the same review. I would stay again with Blake’s listings.
240120,6146783,2019-11-28,Ein liebevoll eingerichtetes Haus mit herzlichen Gastgebern. Ich hab mich von Anfang an zu Hause gefühlt.

866604,49690858,2021-08-28,This place was amazing! It was all my friend and I needed for the entire summer. Ike was more than helpful and accommodating with any questions we had. Location is great and friendly and the room is pretty accurate sizing for the picture! Would definitely stay again!

855394,48489781,2021-07-02,"What to say about Harvin's place! It was modern and sleek, wonderfully clean and cozy, and ultimately a comfortable getaway from the hustle and bustle of Brooklyn when I retired from my day. I booked Harvin's home to extend my stay in New York during my recent travels and I was so lucky to find it! Tucked in the midst of a quiet neighborhood lined with trees, I found an oasis.<br/><br/>Traveling alone, safety is of the utmost importance followed by comfort. Harvin's place fulfilled both of my requirements effortlessly. He stayed in good communication with me during my stay, the instructions provided to enter/exit the unit were easy to understand and execute, in addition to the other house rules. He was also very responsive when I had a concern or questions. Harvin also went above and beyond by offering a number of wonderful places to dine at and patronize in the area and elsewhere, that he thought I might enjoy. Very thoughtful!<br/><br/>Did I mention how clean and well-appointed the unit was? I actually asked Harvin if I could check in a bit earlier than the set time, and he was kind enough to oblige - but only after the cleaning was completed. I appreciated that so much! When I entered it was spotless, smelled wonderful and was nice and cool, again appreciated since NY was experiencing a heatwave that week. There was even some bottle water and beverages chilled in the refrigerator upon my arrival. The are two window A/C units, one in the living area and the other in the bedroom, which both did an amazing job despite the heatwave. I mean those units get COLD. They handle business. Harvin provided all of the necessary items to prepare and have meals in a modern kitchen, and the linens and bath towels/cloths were clean and smelled/felt great. So great, I have a note to ask where he bought them from, lol.<br/><br/>For remote workers (like myself) ... this is a gem. The unit was quiet enough for me to get my work done when I needed to. When I was ready to step outside and explore, it was easy as the home is conveniently located near two subway stops, and a myriad of nice shops, grocers and restaurants within a 5-10 minute walk.<br/><br/>I'm a traveler that loves to get more than they expect, and Harvin's place was absolutely above and beyond my expectations. It truly was an oasis for me and needless to say, I hope to stay here again in the future. Just don't book it when I plan on coming to Brooklyn. ;)<br/><br/>Thank you for such a lovely visit, Harvin!"
345822,11138823,2021-11-01,Another great stay at Shully’s place! Shully and her husband are very accommodating especially with parking . We had everything we needed.
402020,14108870,2019-11-14,"Aleksandra is such a lovely person. She is very easy going and easy to talk to.  The apartment is sparkling clean and  always warm despite the winter weather outside. The room was comfortable and roomy for just myself. It is located just a few minutes walk to the Q line, and 10 min walk to a few other lines. I can definitely recommend Aleksandra and her sweet hospitality."
842473,46829934,2021-09-13,"We loved the location! The hotel is new, beautiful, very comfortable and clean. Fabulous bed and pillows!!<br/>Staff was very friendly and helpful.

704168,32185458,2019-06-03,"Appartement conforme à la description, propre et spacieux, avec de grands dressing, pratique pour les valises et les affaires. Petit conseil concernant le transport, privilégiez la station de métro Utica qui est à 2 arrêts de bus de l'appartement, cette station, contrairement aux autres stations proches de l'appartement, est équipée d'ascenseurs, ce qui peut être utile quand on est chargé avec les bagages."
792583,40472064,2020-07-16,Greta host great place great communication very welcome and spacious. Was really satisfied ❗️
613745,24919764,2019-12-29,"Its s basic apartment<br/>, like 30 years ago in my country, not heating in all rooms, 20 minutes from metro station, but ig you take uber it costs 7-8 euro till metro station"

826760,45114711,2020-10-04,best place for the price!
269678,7572534,2019-02-16,Pros: Ana is a stellar host. She is incredibly courteous and attentive. My room had its own cabletv and the bed was so comfy it could hibernate a bear. Also all trains on the NY Metro are within 10 minutes of walking.<br/><br/>Cons: The room was quite small without functional furniture.
689805,30905264,2019-06-03,"Un séjour parfait, appartement très sympa et propre. Super bien placé, proche métro et centre willimasurg. Produits de toilette disponible et cafetière filtre."
453199,16463655,2021-06-06,"First of all let me start off mr saying my stars are solely based off the hospitality of the people! Great man that helped us everywhere, very friendly, and helpful! The location is about 10 minutes from Times Square, many great bars/restaurants, and the subway is nearby to reach the rest of the city. The location is awesome & safe! This place is ONLY good if you’re only going to sleep there. You have to share a shower/restroom/ with a family that lives there (Across the room). To use the restroom/brush your teeth you’re basically using someone else’s space. We were only there to sleep so it was very convenient for us. We did shower while our stay however and the family is rarely there but if I heard noise I would avoid going to use the rr. Another plus is that you can drink/smoke comfortably and you have a view outside of the window to see the noisy streets and get the real nyc feel. The noise is not super loud it’s very bearable was only loud on a Friday night the rest of the days were not loud. Ac, tv, and wifi worked and room was super clean. I do recommend this place just because I was very comfortable and I was mostly only there to sleep! Thanks so much :)"
772982,38236354,2019-09-02,She is a great person and her place is very comfortable and welcoming. I would recommend anyone to stay with her 6 stars
386376,13495558,2021-11-14,"We stayed at Vinciane’s home for a month and it was absolutely perfect! It was clean, centrally located, and the decor made it feel very cozy. Best of all, Vinciane was truly a wonderful host and really went above and beyond to make sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed. When we come back to visit we hope to stay here again!"
787041,39773237,2019-12-07,"Review for Airbnb<br/><br/>Unfortunately this stay was not as great as we expected it to be. On arrival the apartment was dirty, the floors particularly bad and no mop for us to even rectify ourselves, no toilet paper, curly hairs in the bath. Promised a cleaner that didn’t show 2 days in a row and we waited around to let them in. Day 5 we did get the apt cleaned. Sofa bed is unfit for sleeping and even putting the lumpy old mattress on the floor was barely acceptable. (It is NOT the one in the photo). Also, this apartment has not been renovated as stated. The Super of the apartment let himself in at 10.30 at night while we were sleeping to check we had showed up! Even though the host had someone let us in in person. Radiator wasn’t working for first 2 days and the heaters they left us tripped the power then we lost wifi for a couple of days. Radiator worked for 2 days and then it didn’t work again until Day 11 when water started spraying out of broken radiator onto electric heater in the middle of the night, someone was sent to fix it. No hot water day 3. Day 9 Bathroom door came off its hinges. Day 10 got the radiator back but Day 11 lost hot water again for 4 days. Day 12 Pipes blocked and bath filled with grimy water. <br/>The host did offer to refund the final week and we could move out but we chose to stay. The host did try to fix all problems while we were here. The last 7 days was event free. We grew to enjoy the apartment, I think that’s more about our positive attitude than the apartment though. That said, I would not stay here again or recommend it. Especially if you need more than one bed.<br/>Also, the address is 3476 not 3493"
702013,31933373,2020-10-11,"The apartment is just as pictured & described... spotless, very roomy and stylishly remodeled - loved it!   Bath & kitchen were well-stocked, had thoughtful extras.  And finally, Daniel is a welcoming &  very responsive host, check-in was easy, secure.  It truly is an Ideal vacation home in Brooklyn, and we enjoyed our stay all the more thanks to that!"
815418,43311252,2020-11-22,"Jeniffer’s place was the perfect location to visit the city. Wonderful space, easy to get in and out. She was very accommodating and responsive when needed. Looking forward to returning!"
751820,36039490,2019-07-15,"Excellent location and great host response; Sherry has been very timely and helpful. Parking is amazing; plenty of street parking, which is rare around Flushing, and neighborhood is very nice , esp. for this value. Room is extremely clean and well kept. Would come again."
689857,30905264,2021-06-30,"Pros:<br/>1) Location - great location in Williamsburg with easy access to any subway you would need to get around, and walking distance to all the spots nearby.<br/>2) Fast wifi<br/>3) Communication with host and check-in was easy<br/><br/>Cons:<br/>1) The apartment is a little bit beat up compared to the photos. The furniture has definitely seen better days and is very worn down.<br/>2) Apartment had a bit of a smell to it, not sure where or what it came from but something to be aware of.<br/>3) Linens and towels were not what they look liked in the photos and had some stains on them.<br/><br/>I probably wouldn't stay here again but if you're in a bind and want something in this location it could work."
61091,560078,2019-01-11,"We loved Vana’s apartment - I think it is even better than in the description and pictures. The terrace is beautiful, the interior design with much love, the place is very spacey, clean and cosy. It was easy to get around and plenty of places nearby to have coffee, great food or get grocery. We didn’t get to meet Vana but his communication skills are excellent and his friend Pinar was the perfect guide to his apartment. Would love to stay here again!"
767785,37655428,2020-08-05,Great host. Great stay.
786005,39660725,2019-11-30,"The overall stay at SharedEasy was great. The communication and the property managers Kijuan/Valentina were great. Always there to answer questions and offer support. I had the private room, and unfortunately the A/C which provided heat was not working at all. I stayed for a month and the first 2 weeks were freezing. They made attempts to fix it but it would not budge, so a space heater was provided. I appreciated the temporary fix, but considering the price of the room there is no reason the A/C should be out of service for however long. Amenities like coffee machine, tea, TV, Netflix, and kettle were awesome added touches. The stay was pretty great and the location is pretty central near the J/M near Broadway and all the markets. The bodega is literally around the corner and a bus ride across the street will take you anywhere you want to go. Thanks for a great stay SharedEasy!"
770834,38000066,2021-09-19,"The apartment was clean, comfortable and spacious, with a fully-equipped kitchen. The host Eduard was very accommodating.<br/><br/>Warning for light sleepers like myself - there is noise from the street in the early morning, the bedroom window is right at street level and you hear everything. I was woken up early every morning of my stay there by trucks reversing into the lot next door or by conversations of people passing by the window - you can hear every word as if they're standing in your bedroom."
659679,28625897,2019-04-09,Our stay at Regina’s was a great time. Regina’s place is how it’s described in her profile. She was very friendly and helpful in all our needs. We had an amazing experience exploring Brooklyn by following her tips. We really enjoyed the interesting talks.

792464,40453546,2020-09-30,"Angela’s place was such a warm and cozy safe place for my family of four, especially after a long day in the city. We were greeted with a wonderful host that gave us great local tips and hospitality. The pool was great after driving all day and it was so close to the ferry terminal to get in and out of Manhattan. It was super clean and we had everything we needed. We will definitely be back for our next trip to NY!"
849083,47567206,2021-06-17,"The apartment was perfect. I booked it because I was working in the area and I’m so glad I found this place - Lodeen and her family were so welcoming. The apartment was very clean and inviting - it was nice to return to after a long day. The neighborhood was so cute - nice, quiet street with plenty of parking. I wish I had more time to explore the rest of the area. I would love to book again in the future :)"

161328,3003127,2019-06-30,Ruby was fantastic. She was a great help in getting me situated and was extremely friendly. Thank you.
844387,47050614,2021-04-22,"First, Val is probably one of the most communicative hosts you’ll come across so feel confident in booking!<br/><br/>Now onto the Airbnb, the quarters are small but that’s clear in photos. I think for one it’s perfect, two might be pushing it.<br/><br/>The kitchen is a kitchenette but the way the ceiling is shaped at a drastic angle makes it so you might hit your head a few times and I’m under 5ft so a normal size adult is not going to be able to use the sink in the kitchen or even cook comfortably. <br/><br/>Since the property is split into long term housing in the front and short term in the back, you will have a lot of movement. There will be guests coming in and out, and arriving at different times which is to be expected. They do have cameras so it’s monitored and you’ll be safe.<br/><br/>Since you’re behind the main building you don’t get much noise from the street but there is a restaurant connected to the front building so you will have the bustle of the restaurant cooking, etc. You’ll likely see the workers in the connected courtyard but they’re all incredibly kind.<br/><br/>The check in process isn’t difficult, when I checked in they did have an issue with a previous guest vacating so I had to wait but housekeeping was kind and I could tell they were trying. <br/><br/>I think the bookings are done so closely together that it probably doesn’t give them much wiggle room for incidents. <br/><br/>We had minor issues with internet going down so working virtually might be a gamble depending on day/time but they sent out maintenance to try and fix it quickly. I think it may have been an issue where it’s overloaded since I noticed it would fail when the guest next door would hop on calls then rebound. <br/><br/>I was there for medical reasons so I think for anyone who has difficulty doing stairs or any kind of restrictions — you need to have a support person.<br/><br/>The stairs are narrow and they are only one flight but they wind around so carrying luggage up may not be a smart move. <br/><br/>There’s no smoking on the property but there frequently were guests or workers smoking in the courtyard. You don’t smell it intensely if you close the windows but one window doesn’t close all the way so that’s when you get the smell of smoke. <br/><br/>Overall, it’s safe and it’s totally manageable for a night or two. I wouldn’t consider it a vacation pick but more of an efficient stay. The biggest upside is the maintenance and the hosts being super responsive, there wasn’t one person I interacted with on the property that wasn’t incredibly kind."
712322,32845010,2021-06-27,Very satisfied. Stayed there more than 4 weeks with 2 other asults and my dog.  Would repeat. <br/><br/>-Place is clean; you could eat off the floor<br/>-A/C works great<br/>-Plenty of free parking<br/>- More than 100 of restaurants within 1 mile radius <br/>-Responsive host
692788,31121555,2019-12-16,"Maria and Pete are great, very welcoming and friendly. The room was clean and private. Also located close to subway stations for easy access to Manhattan and downtown Brooklyn."
277931,7887966,2021-08-14,"Angele's place is very spacious, bright with windows in all four directions, on the second floor on comparatively quiet street, still very convenient location just one block from the subway (R and M trains), walking distance to restaurants, supermarket, laundry, etc. The building is old and with character, with somewhat creaky floorboards, but the place is renovated inside. There are two euro-style AC units that were very helpful in keeping the place cool in July/August. Angele is very responsive and helpful, we had a great time in NYC, thank you for hosting us!"
560393,21646774,2020-10-09,Convenient location next to LGA!
878270,50978074,2021-08-09,I had a great stay with Cristobal! Washington Heights is a great neighbourhood and the place was clean and super convenient. Check in was very smooth and everyone was super friendly! Would definitely stay here again. Thank you to Cristobal and his neighbour :)

139696,2111336,2019-07-31,The room is how it is shown in the photo.  It’s spacious and comfortable.  You can use the common kitchen and toilet which were both clean.  There are subway stations which are a few minutes walk to the apartment and some restaurants/cafes.  It was also nice of Kevin to check on me from time to time during my stay to make sure I’m doing fine and he responds quickly too.  It’s overall a good value for a room rental in NYC.
455834,16613394,2019-02-15,Very small but you can find all you need bunk beds but comforters were cozy and warm great place
321606,9775146,2019-11-01,Anu Nicole is a great host. She made me feel at home and replied immediately to everything I asked

709758,32668910,2019-08-18,I had a great stay at Hui’s place!<br/>She communicates really well and is always quick to respond. The apartment was just as it was pictured!  Hui allowed me to have late check without any issues which I thought was sweet.<br/>The location is great close to everything! <br/>I would stay here again:)
780663,39139580,2021-01-17,"Takeshi’s place is exactly as shown. It was beautiful and so cozy. The shower was great, the bed super comfortable. Takeshi was a great host."

343117,10939710,2019-11-25,We had the most pleasant stay with Alex and Mariana. They are great hosts and had awesome tips for our time in NYC. The location is convenient with close metro connections.
767469,37598410,2019-10-02,"This is hands down the best place to stay in New York. The hosts were amazing! They were very understanding, friendly and quick to respond and answer every question that we had. The apartment it self was sparkling clean and it had everything you need and more. We wish we could have stayed longer! Perfect location, close to the subway. I hope to come back again."

738925,34840495,2021-08-08,Philip had a great home for my friends and I to enjoy. Each room had a high quality AC/heater unit which was a pleasant surprise. Philip was also pretty quick to respond. <br/><br/>A+ rating all around!

849341,47716158,2021-04-30,"Un día llegó al alojamiento y me habló de una manera muy inapropiada, me habló en muy mal tono. En muy malos términos. No me sentí para nada cómodo durante el resto de la estadía.<br/>En mi opinión no lo recomiendo en absoluto."
836616,46301785,2021-11-07,Great experience the host were very friendly and made us feel at home highly recommended

693650,31175570,2020-03-01,"This was my first trip to NYC, and my girlfriend and I found this listing. The inside of the apartment was very cozy and has everything you could need. We had a few issues with the listing that weren't mentioned in the apartment description, however. The walls are incredibly thin, so we were awake at 7am even on the weekends, due to noise from upstairs. The bed is also right next to the window, so you can get pretty cold at night. Lastly, the shower is definitely beautiful, but incredibly short. My girlfriend (5'5) mentioned she couldn't fit her head under the showerhead, and I (6'2) was unable to stand up straight due to the low ceiling. Overall, the apartment was good and had everything you could need, but be prepared to wake up incredibly early."
535973,20678811,2019-08-21,Hyacinth was so hospitable and kind during my stay. Always offering help with any questions or the fact she offers water/fruits every day. A great stay for a good price.
759797,36903715,2020-02-25,"Very clean, quiet area. The hosts responds quickly !"
331317,10185955,2020-03-09,Jake is always great  !!!!
208060,4614091,2020-07-11,"The place is exactly as described. Very clean and quiet! The manager (who lives in the bottom apartment) was also very friendly and took the time to introduce himself and make himself available for any and all needs. The place is bright and airy! Air conditioners are located in each room and the layout works well for families with kids. Surprisingly, the bathroom has a sky light and was very clean. <br/><br/>It is only 1 block away from the subway and just a few corners from the highway. Very convenient and quiet neighborhood. <br/><br/>We extended our stay several times with no problems."
461906,16855055,2020-02-09,"Our stay at Tim’s was fantastic - great location, beautiful space, and Tim extremely helpful in checking in and checking out. Can’t wait to return!"
487387,18239876,2019-02-22,"This is a nice, quiet and private apt.  It’s a good place to stay when you are visiting NYC and/or have to go to the hospital."
616176,25071168,2020-11-21,"First, I really appreciate the self-check-in available here, particularly in the time of Covid. I had the opportunity to meet with Bruce on the street outside the brownstone one day as well, and we had a very pleasant conversation.<br/><br/>The apartment itself is very nice - it has an open layout with full kitchen and large living room that are very spacious. Because it is ground level, the apartment doesn't get a ton of natural light, but there is ample lighting so it wasn't really a problem, and it also meant that I slept like a baby!<br/><br/>The bedroom has a desk, chair, and monitor (and printer) which were ideal for a remote working situation like the one I was in. The backyard area is also very nice, and a great reprieve particularly with a cup of tea or a drink.<br/><br/>Bruce prepared an excellent guide to the apartment in a binder when you arrive, and left some thoughtful snacks as well. Overall, I couldn't be happier with my stay."
695195,31269703,2019-10-15,Me and my boyfriend were highly disappointed by this place the big thing was that it smelled really bad(we had to buy air fresheners) and it was almost impossible to find parking after dark. Overall would not recommend.
845064,47156759,2021-06-20,We stayed in Michaela's place for a week in June. It was a lovely time. Plenty of space and plenty of walking and eating to be done.
256644,6808818,2020-05-09,beautiful space and lovely host :) backyard also was a plus it was absolutely stunning
852238,48042018,2021-10-10,"The place was just as advertised. Quick walk to target, Costco, and Aldi’s. 10-15 minute walk to the subway. Great communication. Great place to stay with kids."
550104,21278102,2019-03-10,The room is exactly how you see it in the pictures. Nicely decorated and with the charm of old newyorkese houses. I loved the windows so much!<br/>Full of light and jazz music playing.<br/>Pure bliss
284212,8115423,2019-10-26,"I had an amazing stay. Esteban is a wonderful host. The place was clean,  comfortable, and super chill. Breakfast was really nice and really enjoyed the conversations with Esteban."

458212,16683957,2019-09-30,Emre’s apartment is the perfect spot to stay at in BK. It’s cozy and comfortable and in a great location to access the subway and restaurants. Emre was super responsive and helpful when needed. I highly recommend his spot if you can get it.
886660,52072536,2021-09-30,Great place to stay by the Barclays center. The place was nice just like the description. A lot is close by. The host was great as well.
474612,17609502,2019-05-07,Kevin was an amazing host! He provided a comfortable stay and accomodated my husband with a late check-in. There were lots of food options right around the corner and the distance to JFK airport couldn't have been more ideal! It was very clean and we appreciate the hospitality!
394183,13788132,2021-06-30,Great host and excellent communication. Will definitely book with host in the future.
767445,37594699,2021-09-06,Nice place in a convenient location. Everything you could need is a mere 2-5 minute walk away. The air Bnb itself was also more spacious than I expected. Pol was easy to reach and helpful. I would stay here again
80833,819893,2020-05-07,"This is a very nice place to stay in Hamilton Heights. It's very close to the 137th Street Subway Station, lots of shops, and Aletia is a good, experienced host. Food for long term stays."

882186,51520023,2021-10-19,"Lily was very helpful in navigating the area, and check in was very easy! Just as a note: it’s about a 15-20 minute walk to the metro, and the apartment is on the 6th floor with no elevator (so plan luggage/accessibility accordingly). We had 3 guests very comfortably, but could’ve added one more with no problem! The apartment is so charming and beautiful, and the East Village has so much cool art and culture to explore. (If you’re gluten free, swing by Tompkins Square Bagels!)"
746815,35491909,2019-10-06,"Lovely place, great value 3 min walk from metro"
877259,50897694,2021-11-29,"Wow, just WOW! So fresh, clean, and comfortable. Such thought put into decor, design and the amenities. Extra special touch was leaving eggs, bread, cream, waters, etc. in the fridge for our use. We hope to be able to book every time we visit our children who live one block away. <br/>Host, Anthony, came out front to greet us on day 2 and showed us his garden level space. His Bed-Stuy hospitality rivals our southern hospitality! <br/>I’m a clean-freak. Everything was pristine. That’s difficult in a historic property! <br/>Highly recommend! Appreciate such a quality host and space."
799692,41263496,2021-11-10,Great host and comfortable apartment!
675166,29855428,2019-06-22,"I only stayed here for one night in between a late night flight and an early morning flight, but if I’m ever in the area again I’d love to stay here! Melitza was so kind and really quick with communicating. The space was nice and very clean. If it is quiet sometimes you can hear some noises from the street or upstairs but that didn’t bother me at all, just something to keep in mind if you’re sensitive to that."
715226,33085491,2019-07-06,"Super appartement.<br/>Nous avons passé 10 jours a New York et l appartement a été parfait. Grand, confortable.<br/>Certes, le quartier est un peu dégradé et il faut presque une heure pour rejoindre Manhattan, mais pour le prix il permet vraiment de se reposer après les grosses journées de visite.<br/><br/>Merci aux hôtes qui habitent au dessous et qui ont réglé rapidement les différents petits soucis. Par exemple, ils ont modifié leur wifi car nos téléphones européens ne la captaient pas"
576872,22376093,2021-06-13,"Fuck this place now before you miss out! I’ve been to plenty of Airbnb‘s and this was one of the best experiences I’ve ever had. Great place, great location, and a great host!"
583872,22751269,2021-11-05,Nice people working at the desk.
517365,19717723,2019-09-24,One of the best Airbnb's I have stayed at - Marija is a great host responding almost in real time! The location is perfect. The place was spotless and not that tiny at all! I stayed a week and could not have found a better place. This is the East Village: full of vibe and buzz. If you are looking for the peace and quietness of a Zen Monastery; don't stay in the East Village.... Happy travels
845807,47227168,2021-04-04,Awesome place !!! Enjoyed my stay here
838476,46436583,2021-10-08,This is an amazing place the owner works with you and is amazing we definitely will be back and would love to stay here again
681602,30229561,2019-09-01,Good place and good location. Alexander is very hospitable. Just make sure how the doors work beforehand.
420239,15009751,2019-05-02,"From the moment you walk through the front door of this apartment be prepared to feel like a ‘New Yorker’. The apartment is beautifully furnished, exquisitely decorated, and spotlessly clean, it is even better than the photos! The apartment is located in a beautiful street away from the hustle and bustle yet close enough to all you need. Central Park, subways, supermarkets, restaurants and shops are at your doorstep, all within easy walking distance. There is laundry in the basement which was very handy and very reasonably priced. Lisa truly is the perfect host, she went out of her way to make sure we were settled, comfortable and had everything we needed, she was very prompt in answering any queries we had, nothing was too much trouble for her. If we ever return to this fabulous city we would not hesitate in staying here again. Thanks Lisa your hospitality and beautiful apartment enhanced our New York experience and made a great holiday even better than we could have imagined."
747373,35532705,2021-04-26,Great location + nice view

The bed was very comfortable. The highlight is the incredible roof deck with 360 views !! Would definitely stay again, thanks so much!!!"

553806,21427369,2019-01-10,"Amazing place, very accurate to pictures, great location, great hospitality. <br/>Highly recommend!"
710927,32777169,2020-09-05,The washer and dryer was the best about the whole spot. The address on the place was wrong when we arrived and the host had to text us and give the actual address. The host was in the middle of moving . The room is small  and cozy /‘d the place was quaint.
720029,33498269,2019-10-08,We loved staying at this cute apartment in the lower east side. The space is super close to nightlife so just be aware that one weekends it gets very loud at night and without ear plugs it can be hard to sleep. Renata provides one pair so bring your own if you're traveling with friends.
655351,28334760,2021-09-08,The room is stunning (and huge!) and the hosts are absolutely lovely (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) would recommend to anyone.
813150,43002696,2021-09-17,"Todo perfecto, la ubicación increíble y la atención de Emmanuel muy buena"

481947,17980714,2019-06-07,Good location
744804,35341842,2021-08-22,Cozy quiet and private. The area and even the entrance to the property really gave the Brooklyn vibe. Plenty of good food near by. And Coney island was only a 20 min drive.
779658,39024603,2019-11-13,"Really fun, cool place. Great for the price and a lovely host. Great cats"
465752,17142987,2019-03-26,"It was my first time using air bnb to rent a place. The apartment was stunning and very welcoming, not to mention it had amazing amenities. The apartment is located in a very safe neighborhood, so we felt very comfortable. There was a slight issue with checking in as we had requested an earlier check in time, but Daniel was quick to respond to us and immediately came down. Overall, an amazing experience and would definitely stay again!"
691796,31086198,2019-03-31,"Great hospitality, and kind and speedy communication. The place is clean and conveniently located next to the airport. The bed is comfy, the en-suite bathroom clean and stylish."
388914,13582811,2019-12-22,"Not joking about it being a diamond in the rough. Very rough area. The subway is close but if your planning on being out late in the city don’t take it home, the walk is not worth the risk. It was great to have parking but was constantly worried about my car. The shower is nonworking, be prepared to take a bath. The mattress is like sleeping on a rock. Extremely cold. No hot water in the sink only the shower. Was hoping this would be a good find but I will not be returning."
343088,10939710,2019-04-12,The stay in Alex’s house was wonderful! I definitely recommend you to stay in the house when you visit NYC!
666006,29100541,2019-11-13,"Great location. Near lots of restaurants and cafe within 1-10 minute walk. About 12+ minutes walk to trains ( E,F,M,R plus LIRR) and 2 min walk to bus Q 23 and an express to Manhattan (30 minutes) <br/><br/>Host has been wonderful. If you need anything, just ask the host and they will respond right away. <br/><br/>The place is clean and you have your own entrance from the back yard. It's dark at night but safe. Bathroom is big and private. Shower is high pressure. The room itself is medium sized but definitely good for 2 people. I had a ""truckful "" of stuff  for this stay  and everything fit well. Bed is soft and very comfortable for me who is usually a firm bed sleeper. There is wifi and a fridge with a tiny freezer with ice cubes. No TV. A coffee table and 2 chairs. <br/><br/>Tips for guests: 1-mentally mark your entrance upon arrival by the number of gates or car garages etc. 2-And walk around 1 block radius to know the best way for your cab to drop you off if you have heavy luggages. 3-And to open the window: turn both knobs to the right."
356576,11905189,2021-08-09,Jamie is great at communicating. Easy check in... Parking wasn't easy but that's expected in NYC. Train station is a 12-14 min walk. Do your research for Bed-Stuy neighborhood before booking. Clean place... Great host. Need more bedding and linens though so I gave it a 4 for now.
713517,32890591,2019-05-14,"Just above upper Manhattan. Easy to transit to and from. A lovely space tucked away from the hustle and bustle. Kind and helpful hosts, informative and easy to communicate with! Spent 7 days in a clean and cute room! This is an open artistic space."
877142,50885127,2021-11-30,"A super stylish and wonderfully located apartment in NYC.  The bedroom loft is very spacious and has plenty of closet space.  The downstairs, living area is comfortable and chic.  We felt so at home during our Thanksgiving stay and our fantasy football fans loved the projector upstairs for watching the games.  The subway and the bus were just a couple blocks away and between the bodegas, Target, and Trader Joe’s, we never wanted for food and drink.  Plus, the best bagels are just a few streets away at Tompkins’s, Supermoon and their Ferrero-Rocher cruffins were just a short walk from the house, and there are so many great restaurants around the East Village.  Wonderful apartment and a wonderful stay!"
348203,11371535,2019-01-27,A really comfortable place!! It has everything we needed and even more!!
116645,1524017,2019-04-11,Was awesome and I definitely will come again <br/>Greg

677847,29984607,2019-05-18,"This place is filthy. It was clear that the comforter had not been washed in a long time. There were disgusting crusty spots on it, and the towel they laid out for me was sitting right on top of that. I slept in my dirty clothes to avoid touching the sheets in my short pajamas and laid a shirt on top of the pillow so I wouldn’t have to touch the pillow case.<br/><br/>The bathroom has stains in the tub and there were bits of hair littering the floor. Given that and the fact that the towel was on the comforter I decided not to shower for the day and a half I was staying there and wait until I got home. <br/><br/>The common areas are passable, but there is a weird curtained partition that serves as a third bedroom... I don’t remember seeing that in the description, but I may have missed it.<br/><br/>The only nice things I can say are that the location is fine, the area seemed safe, and the host left a binder of things to do in the area."
873776,50487933,2021-07-04,Nice. Quiet and friendly neighbors. Great location to amenities and restaurants.

712813,32854456,2020-02-16,"I was lucky to be able to stay in this house.<br/>They welcomed us very kindly.<br/><br/>The house was comfortable like my house and was clean, quiet and secure.<br/><br/>The bedroom, kitchen, living room and toilet were all perfect.  Home appliances and household items were perfect.  It was the best hostel in my life.  It was much better than the hotel. Just Perfect.<br/><br/>If i travel to New York again, i will stay in this house.<br/>No other choice is required. I will choose this house."

316731,9563873,2020-02-02,"I will start by saying Steve and his wife are the most amazing hosts.  This by far has been the best Airbnb experience I have had.  The room is lovely and clean as are the shared dining room, kitchen and bathroom areas.  They have set the bar for hospitality. Conveniently located near bus and subway transportation.  All around, great value and I highly recommend!"

420711,15052455,2020-01-01,"We have mixed feelings about our stay. I’m going to begin with the positive aspects : The neighborhood was really nice and the house was nicely decorated and full of good art. The kitchen is really big and the couch area is really nice. Or room had a lock which was good. The subway is really close and you can also walk because everything’s quite close in Brooklyn. There’s a nice supermarket nearby so we can easily eat and cook dinner at home. <br/><br/>But we also encountered a lot of problems ; sanitary problems with a pile of garbage in front of our window and the fact that we couldn’t open them to air the room. The sheets of our bed were not clean and the convertible couch was full of dust and crumbs. The oven was really disgusting and we felt like the house was not perfectly clean overall. We also encountered problems when we arrived because Kimberly told us last minute that the keys of the apartment where not where they were supposed to be. Some things like the heat or the bathtub weren’t really easy to use and I think it would’ve been easier with instructions. Kimberly wasn’t here for most of our stay but do you only day that you were there she turn off the heat completely and we both got sick because it was really cold outside... and the last thing was that the Wi-Fi was not working really well and we had a lot of problems with it. Since the price of the stay is quite high, we shouldn’t have had so many troubles and problems with both hygiene and communication and the house itself.  We felt that our experience was not really worth the price... and that’s a shame because without all these really disturbing elements our stay would’ve been great."
755269,36322141,2019-07-29,Excellent host; generous smile; and prompt communication.
704068,32171100,2019-08-31,"The house is comfortable and clean.  <br/>The location is excellent, meters away there are subway stops, markets and much more .. but the best was Josefina, friendly, attentive to everything and predisposed.  We recommend it 100%"

844326,47050584,2021-03-22,"Close to trains, shops, restaurants. Large, unfurnished back yard. Room was furnished with just a bed, a tiny night stand. Worth the value. Quiet for the most part. Other residents were very pleasant."

807023,42326187,2021-11-28,"I have to start by saying I love the aesthetic of this loft! Definitely a boho, cozy little place that I could spend all of my days. If this trip were for me and my friends I would have definitely given it a higher rating. This review is a mix of my input (27) as well as my parents (mid 50s). <br/><br/>Pros: <br/>Close to many markets, restaurants/fast food and the subway. <br/><br/>Many personal touches: games, books, hangers/hanging rack, television. <br/><br/>The balcony is such a great spot for coffee in the morning or wine in the evening. <br/><br/>Cute cute cute <br/><br/>Hosts are very, very kind and quick to respond. <br/><br/>Check in and out was very easy. <br/><br/>Cons:<br/>So dusty! My allergies were on 10 from the moment we walked in the door. The rugs in the living area were really dirty. <br/><br/>This place is not for the faint of heart, there are several stairs that lead into the entrance of the loft (NOT AN ISSUE AT ALL for me but my parents struggled a bit). <br/><br/>Many dirty utensils and dishes were put away. <br/><br/>Bed in the living area is not very comfy but the others definitely were! <br/><br/>Overall 4/5 for me. If it were cleaner, I would have been much happier with my stay."
837889,46414136,2020-12-23,"Excelente en todos los aspectos, muy cerca del Puente de Brooklyn, World Trade Center y todo lo del Distrito Financiero. Además fue muy cómoda la habitación es un hotel con buena atención y servicio"

It is a great neighborhood and everything you need is close by. Even though it is a lively neighborhood, the apartment is quiet and comfortable and the cats were terrific. We really enjoyed our two months there."

It’s not far from the city, overall the location is very convenient. <br/>Her home is very tidy, and Karin provided some basic amenities and her home was fully stocked if you wanted to cook or iron or something.<br/>There’s a laundromat on the floor, which is great. <br/>The room is so sunny and you can often find some company as Karron’s friendly feline likes the windowsill. <br/>Overall, I have no complaints and I recommend you book here!"

The location is truly superb. <br/><br/>Michael himself is a warm, open-hearted gent, always ready to offer up a hot tip on something to do and a good guy to have a laugh with.<br/><br/>My 5 weeks in New York were made all the more special for having this apartment as my temporary home.<br/><br/>Do not hesitate to check this space out."

I would definitely book here again

If you don't need much, you'll be quite independent and happy on your own, and may never meet her or other building staff; everyone honors your privacy. <br/><br/>The bedding and towels had a delightful freshly-washed scent when I checked in, the bed and pillows were amazingly comfortable throughout my entire stay, and the soft glow of the sun over the balcony in the morning was delightful and calming to wake up to. I think my favorite thing about the apartment was its cheerful color pallete. <br/><br/>Also worth noting is that literally everything that you could need in the area is within arm's reach: groceries, leisure shopping, restaurants, bars, storage, laundry, pharmacies, transportation, - everything!"

There were many cafes and restaurants, both casual and more formal -- made for great eating. The neighborhood is very walkable, and (given the pandemic) there were many outdoor seating choices and streets dedicated to pedestrians. Public transportation was just down the block.

The place itself is small, but very stylish and has everything you need (except much room for your luggage, if you are 2 persons). We really appreciated all the tips Jennifer has ready for her guests, so everyone can make the most of their time in the city! Also the complementary coffee and English muffins for breakfast were a great add on. We can definitely recommend this place for anyone, who likes staying at the heart of Manhattan!"
864755,49444503,2021-07-18,budget option for sure! can't complain at all but the AC wasn't super powerful so it was really hot. otherwise Conrad was a great host and I would recommend for those looking for good value

The apartment itself was good - cozy but the bathroom had a couple plumbing issues and there were small flies all around. It is a basement so it gets dark. Aside from this it is well kept and served our purpose for the trip."
644894,27528267,2020-03-09,The location was pretty conveniently situated with respect to the subway stations and was pretty safe too even late at night.

It’s clean, well decorated, spacious, and has all of the things a solo traveler or couple would need to have a perfect Brooklyn stay. The location is amazing as the apartment is within walking distance of the subway, restaurants, coffee shops, and grocery stores. I would absolutely stay in this place every time I come back to Brooklyn. Lastly, Sara was a wonderful host who’s communicative and made check in and check out incredibly easy."

The apartment was quite spacious for NY and very clean with plenty of linens. Central Park was just a quick 5 min walk which was awesome. Tons of food nearby and grocery street across street. We would be quick to come back for another stay. Thanks Kate for a wonderful stay and your hospitality!

823842,44572773,2021-09-26,"Gabriela’s place is so wonderful,  as is the experience of staying at her place. You have a very real experience of having your own place in the LES of NYC and her apartment is fascinating. This is not the place of cheap furniture purchased for transient guests. It is filled with collectibles from her travels, great literature, and a chef’s set of cooking supplies. While this sophisticated LES haunt is -slightly- on the edge of the developing up market neighborhood, (and by slightly, I mean Celebrity Chef Chris Santos’ Beauty and Essex is practically next door), it is close enough to walk two blocks to be in the best the neighborhood has to offer. The Magician, one of the best neighborhood bars is around the corner.   I really can’t recommend this place enough!"

572398,22187361,2021-08-06,"The hospitality and prompt communication from the host makes the entire stay pleasant and easy. The apartment is everything and more as described, and the location is just a dream.<br/><br/>Though we consider ourselves as New Yorker, we just saw West Village through an entirely different sense, largely to the convenience that your apartment brought in - close to subways, parks, restaurants, shopping, bars, running tracks and grocery stores to name a few.<br/><br/>Apartment was fully equipped, and all gadgets worked with absolute ease and convenience.  we expect ourselves to reach out again in the future during our next visit to NY.<br/>Thanks again!"
599144,23808650,2021-07-21,Michael is very kind and warm. The place is pretty close to key transportation.

881113,51357616,2021-09-27,Super close to LaGuardia airport! Comfy 2 bedroom very clean and comfortable. Beds were tall so be cautious. Perfect amount of space. Easy check in and easy access to get around
824098,44632833,2021-01-03,"We stayed at Michael’s place for two weeks over the holidays. It was the perfect place for our family as we have two children aged one and four. The kids were over the moon about all the awesome toys in “their new house”. We brought toys and books for them and felt silly doing so after discovering the number of books and toys available at the home! Michael had all the kid things you need but don’t necessarily want to travel with. For example, they have a high chair, small eating utensils, small table and chair for eating and playing. It was also super convenient to have a washer and dryer due to the length of our stay. We drove from Chicago and had no issues with parking on the block or a block away which is great compared to other parts of BK. There are a ton of food options within walking distance and also a supermarket a block and a half away. The home itself is very comfortable and suited all of our needs. The kitchen was amazing and I wish I could copy paste it into my home. Of course there are minor things that come with staying in an older home - namely that the stairs were a little creaky but I think that’s part of the charm. Overall, I loved our stay and would highly recommend Michael’s place especially to those traveling with children."
408989,14472272,2019-03-02,The photos don’t do this place justice. It was amazing and I loved it. It’s perfect for a getaway.

There is a beautiful outdoor courtyard you are free to use. My only minor issue is that it is on the 4th floor, which I don't think was mentioned in the listing..(maybe I missed it )  A little hard on the knees if you are older, otherwise great!"

617209,25138442,2019-01-03,Irina’s place was very nice! It was a tight squeeze with 4 people but still a great experience! The only hard part was the amount of utensils provided but if you stay on top of your cleaning it is doable. Subway and bus stations were very close by and there were GREAT food options around. Would definitely recommend to a friend!
260839,7024138,2021-05-28,Be is a great host and they were extremely communicative and helpful. The space is exactly as described and a wonderful value. The apartment is very clean and comfortable. I will definitely recommend this spot to others who visit NYC.

We dealt mostly with Lou and he went above and beyond to make sure that our stay was perfect. Thank you, Lou!!!  We actually had the pleasure to meet  Laverne on our last night there as she'd been out of town almost the entire time we were there. It was a very nice treat. We would love to stay in this place again on our next trip to NYC."

It was very clean and comfortable, and the bus stop was just a minute or two from the front door and took us right into the heart of downtown. The subway was also nearby, so we were able to get around town with ease, and having a small kitchen made it perfect for us to walk to the nearby Whole Foods and eat in to save a little money. Diane was very hospitable, quick to respond, and had good tips for our stay as well. If I go back to New York I’d look this place up again."
724146,33907325,2019-11-29,This place is beautiful! It is secure and stylish. There was plenty of parking around. The rooms were really clean. They had a lot of amenities that made the room stand out. I would give it a 10 out of 10. I definitely recommend this place.

710889,32777169,2019-12-01,"Good location, price-quality is reasonable, it was clean and the place is nicely decorated. Sometimes the water in the shower was cold, it was always chilly in the room, the hanger and bed slat were broken in the room, the host didn’t come to fix it when we asked (we asked the night we arrived and we stayed for four days). Other than that, the stay was nice, the kitchen is comfortable to use and the experience as a whole is positive. :)"
372665,12966225,2020-02-10,Excellent for short stays close proximity to everything you need - food groceries banks etc. - and a reasonable ride to Manhattan. No complaints from the host about my 4 year olds noisy tendencies. Much more peaceful than staying in any other burrow (which says a lot coming from a native new Yorker). First time in Staten Island won't be my last time thanks to Don.

834833,46089673,2021-10-06,"This was my first time staying in a shared space on Airbnb and traveling alone, and I was grateful to have a smooth and pleasant stay with Stanley. Because of his hours as a nurse and my own late-night schedule we only crossed paths in the apartment once, but he was very polite and communicative ahead of my stay. The apartment was very comfortable and a short walk to the metro line into Manhattan or elsewhere in Brooklyn."
489385,18358606,2019-04-03,"Kate was very accommodating. The apartment had plenty of space for my family of 6. The subway is right across the street and Central Park is a short walk away. There are several cute & delicious local restaurants and coffee shops right around the corner (Effy’s, Frenchy’s & Lexington Social were enjoyed by my fam). Definitely priced appropriately for the space offered."

373492,13004996,2021-10-24,Beth’s place is perfect for a quick couple’s getaway from Manhattan. We brought our bikes over via the Ferry and rode along the beach. Convenient to visit the grocery nearby and has everything you need to cook a nice meal. One thing I would suggest is looking into your dining options and the neighborhood before hand—not quite the same hours as we’re used to (and spoiled by) elsewhere in the city.
757395,36640816,2021-09-14,Excellent place to stay close to JFK and public transit in Queens! Louann was excellent and met me early so I could drop off a bag before I headed into the city.<br/><br/>I will definitely stay here again!

Needed a place that still felt like home and was spacious enough for myself and 3 daughters. Having the 2 bedrooms, 2 bathrooms and high ceilings gave us the room we needed to enjoy the apt and the city.  Tripp being an artist, used the 20 foot ceilings to make it feel like you are living in an art gallery.  Tripp also responded quickly when anything was needed.  I would come back next time I am back in NY."

Anthony is incredibly responsive and helpful and welcomed us personally upon arrival to show us around.  *Please note that his beautiful apartment is located on the top floor, so there are quite a few steps to manage.

There are other AirBNB guests, and when one left I saw the hosts cleaning the bedroom and bathroom, cleaning sheets and towels, which was great to see. I would 110% stay at this place if I come back. Also like a 7 min walk to the station. I walked back at 11pm on multiple nights and felt safe in the neighborhood."

11497,44096,2019-05-18,"Waundell’s place is a great option for the solo traveler looking for a clean place to lay their head for the night. <br/>My room with a view was right to Yankee Stadium so it is next to a highway. If you are a light sleeper it might be a little noisy for you. <br/>The room is immaculate. The single bed and pillows were soft and warm. The room also has a chair and desk, heater, and fan. <br/>The bathroom was nice and tidy and it looks like it is cleaned pretty often. All the amenities you can needed were either in the bathroom or in the supply closet right next to the bathroom. <br/>Waundell is an amazing host. He’s very accommodating and easy to talk to. If you have any questions at all he is very easy to get in contact with and very good about responding as well. It made my trip a lot easier having a clean and cozy place to stay.

810730,42686626,2021-09-11,A small but private room.  I was in town for the Subway Series and it is located very close to the Q48 bus route which takes you right to Citi Field.  Was pleased with the stay.
703588,32094042,2021-10-31,Not bad for pricing at all
741337,35085826,2021-03-07,"The space is very clean. She provides basic cooking amenities which is very convenient. The bed is extremely comfortable as well. The bathroom is nice and small however be careful with the plumbing. For example, do not run the sink and use the toilet at the same time because all the pipes will clog. The shower was really nice with multiple shower heads and a detachable shower hose which is really nice. She provided snacks and check in was seamless. The heater was really good since it was extremely cold during my stay. For the price, location(literally a three minute walk to the train station) and amenities, I would recommend Geri’s place to everyone."
786048,39673143,2019-12-01,"Great space! Way more space than I expected which was great! I was able to connect my phone to the tv!

He answered every time I texted with a question no matter the time & within minutes! Will definitely book again!!"
261996,7086310,2021-06-06,"Great place. I’ll give all the details - their home smells like the whole body section of a Whole Foods (in the best way). Wouldn’t be surprised if they have almost a thousand books as well. The bedroom was clean and had lots of light. The road did get noisy and wake us up once or twice during our stay, but heavier sleepers shouldn’t have issues there.<br/><br/>John and Kelsey were super cool and very helpful. They also make incredible bread! Would recommend for anyone that is pretty social or just wants to know more about the city!"

The location felt safe and neighborly, and there are cafes, restaurants, and shops in short walking distance.  Train stop is close and street parking is available.  Jessica's communication was clear, quick, helpful, and friendly before, during, and after my stay.  I really felt taken care of.  Hope to see be back again soon!"

754430,36253150,2019-10-12,Sue Ellen's place is well positioned next to the metro line and not far from the beach. Unfortunately due to the weather and the renovations in the back yard we weren't able to capitalize on the more summery aspects of the place. The apartments sub-terranean location was a bonus in this case because it definitely made it more cozy. Apartment is well thought-out and  tastefully decorated.

883949,51726344,2021-11-15,"In general, this was a nice bedroom in a renovated apartment, close to a metro station and Central Park. The bedroom that we stayed in was different from the one advertised but it was nice in general. The rest of the apartment was exactly like the pictures. The only thing is that one of the bathrooms was very dirty, but the other one was clean so we used that one. Communication with Luci and Kevin was easy and they always replied very quickly."
844343,47050584,2021-08-05,No TV like in listing. Bedding is basically plastic stuff and makes a lot of noise if you move around. No soap in bathroom or shower either. Overall convenient location right outside subway station and pretty cheap so can't complain too much

356578,11905189,2021-08-16,Jamie’s place in Bed-Stuy makes for a great base camp in NYC. The apartment is simple and comfortable. It was super quiet during our stay and the mattress was very comfortable. Jamie has a great collection of art on the walls that adds character to the place. <br/>The window AC unit kept the apartment cool in the crazy heat we experienced during our stay. <br/><br/>Jamie was a super communicative host and he had lots of suggestions for things to do and places to eat. He made us feel very welcome from the beginning!
88335,905947,2019-07-15,"I didn't have the greatest experience at Shelley's place. Truthfully, I felt a unwelcomed and got the feeling she was irritated with me which made be slightly uncomfortable throughout my stay. However this listing is as it says, you will have a clean place to lay your head and keep your belongings. Her place is close to bus stop and not too far away from the train. It took me about 40-45 mins to get Manhattan from her place. The bathroom was very clean, however is not on the same floor as the room, so that is something to keep in mind. Personally, I would not stay again just because I didn't feel welcomed."
733850,34374201,2021-08-01,"The place was clean and comfortable, with a convenient location to transit and a great value for the price. Crystal was kind, friendly, and accommodating.

287245,8254405,2021-01-02,Perfect little stay in the Bronx away from all the busyness of the city but the subway is a close walk away. The room is tiny but we only used it for sleeping so the size worked perfectly for us.

613691,24916571,2021-11-01,"Cecilia’s place couldn’t be lovelier! It’s on a quiet street in Greenpoint, but a short walk to everything you need and what the neighborhood offers (subway, park, food/drinks, coffee, etc). I visited Grumpy’s Cafe many mornings! The inside of the apartment is cozy and charming. It has two bedrooms if needed and a small kitchenette. Even though there isn’t a stove, the hot plate works really well! There isn’t an oven either, but there’s a microwave, and chances are you can get by without it. I stayed for 2.5 weeks, and had everything I needed. There were also toiletries and coffee provided, which was a very thoughtful touch and very much appreciated :) It was the perfect place to land when I moved back to NY. Cecilia was always responsive and helped me out when I needed to change my reservation dates and needed a later check-out time. I highly recommend to others!"
261297,7037918,2019-10-18,I needed a place to crash before a flight and this place met all my requirements. There is transportation to the airport nearby and it is fairly priced.

358081,12052143,2019-03-25,This apartment is in a fantastic location. As a base it was great but I had been expecting a more obvious sofa bed with bedding which I could have used and in the end we just had to share the bed which was fine in our circumstances but had we been more people it would not have worked out! The check out arrangements weren’t ideal either and added a bit of unnecessary stress at the end of the holiday. But overall we had a good stay.
409000,14472272,2019-05-29,Great location. Wonderful host.

782872,39369799,2021-01-01,"Jelena’s place was amazing. It’s very stylish and just as the pictures show. The home was very clean and I loved all of the upgrades. She was able to provide extras for the baby which made for much easier travels. We were a family of 2 adults, 2 kids and a baby and we were comfortable with a queen bed, pull out sofa and play yard. There’s a supermarket  to pick up a few groceries to cook breakfast before going out for the day and train close by which was perfect for getting around. I loved the little Dominican restaurant on the corner as well! Will stay again on my next trip."

621235,25448433,2019-10-28,"I had a good stay at Rachel's place.   The room is huge, as seen in the pictures. The location is great, very close to the subway station and has many good restaurants around that make up for not being able to use the kitchen. The apartment isn't new, but it is well kept and clean. I saw a few bugs running around that looked like small cockroaches, but nothing too annoying."

887590,52186099,2021-10-31,"I planned a surprise getaway for my man’s birthday. Invited a couple of his friends and added 6 people to the reservation.  For some reason there was just something fishy about the whole thing. I booked from the 29th-31st of October, I was inquired on spending an additional night and my bill just jumped. Then two days before checking (mind you I’ve paid and everything) then the hosts hits me with I have to pay another $200 upon check in for a cleaning fee. So at this point I was just confused but I had no other choice because we leave in 2 days . The morning that we got there the host texted me and said someone would get in touch with me before check in. We waited almost 2 hours in the cold. No one answered any calls, thank goodness for one of the other tenants that gave us one of the landlords number. We called Airbnb all the way in Vietnam before we finally got assistance. We had to wait in the eateries nearby to get heat and phone charge. We finally got in the Airbnb, it was alright for the most part till we saw a Rat.  The house was spotless and very spacious but it was dusty, particles every. The heat barely worked. The stove and microwave shut off at first but it was fixed. The concierge was very friendly , but he wanted us to send the $200 via cashapp or zelle which was fishy. But we insisted that he bill us through the Airbnb app. Then after we left they expected us to leave the house sparkling clean when they took $200 . Location is ok, just a bunch of school kids everywhere and the street parking is ass but that’s New York for you. Overall we had a good time, and the place was alright but it didn’t have to be that complicated. Btw if you love to cook, you’d have to buy your pots , spoons, etc."
11495,44096,2019-05-07,"Best host ever!!<br/>Very friendly and welcoming, I felt so comfortable, good person, and great communicator."
817171,43544781,2021-05-30,"Loved my stay! The apt is bright, airy, and very charming (i.e., well decorated, great views), not to mention super clean. The location near Domino Park was wonderful, with lots of cute restaurants and stores nearby.  Depending on which subway line you're looking to take, the walk can be between 10-15 minutes.  The building also had an elevator, which I always appreciate. I definitely recommend and would stay here again in a heartbeat!"

732732,34318362,2019-09-09,"This is a great Air BnB to stay in when you come to NY! The apartment is beautiful and clean, the neighborhood and neighbors are great as well. There are wonderful coffee shops and restaurants within walking distance and it is just a few blocks from the G train to go into Manhattan. Also just a couple stops north will bring you to Willamsburg where you will find a lot of nightlife and shopping. Or a couple stops south and you can go to the Brooklyn Museum and beautiful Prospect Park.I can't recommend David's place enough or him as a better host."

791856,40376349,2021-11-17,"Great location with good access to subway. Good amenities in the area.<br/><br/>One of the bedrooms was a sofa bed, which was fine. However, the first bedroom is immediately inside the front door and to use the bathroom, you have to go through the second bedroom. Not ideal for privacy and was difficult to not disturb the person staying with me if I needed to use the bathroom in the night. Similarly if my friend woke early, he would have to wait for me to wake before he could leave  the apartment as he would have woken me up.<br/><br/>Bathroom is extremely small, although amenities were good.<br/><br/>Had slight issue with opening the front door, the key was v sticky but the host was responsive and offered to come and help. I advised we were leaving to check out so no need, but perhaps could change key and lock for future ease for guests"

When back in the New York City area, I/we will stay again.  Thanks, again."
571517,22166055,2019-11-07,"Wir waren eine ganze Woche in Myles´ Wohnung und haben uns sehr wohl gefühlt. Es hat uns sehr gut gefallen und Myles ist ein toller Gastgeber. Er hat an alles gedacht: Die Küche ist voll ausgestattet, Handtücher waren vorhanden und wurden sogar während der Woche ersetzt, die Wohnung war sauber und ordentlich, es waren Hygieneartikel vorhanden, Snacks und Schoki waren bereitgelegen,... <br/>Der Check-in war dank eines Codes, den Myles uns 2 Tage vorher geschickt hat sehr unkompliziert und schnell möglich. Myles hat immer sehr schnell geantwortet - vor unserem Aufenthalt und auch währendesssen. Die Kommunikation war sehr unkompliziert und herzlich. <br/>Besonders super ist die Nähe zur Metro (unter 5min). Die Fahrt in die Stadt (z.B. Times Square) dauert allerdings schon so 40min, aber alles machbar und in New York gehört Metrofahren ja auch zur ""Experience"" dazu. Die Nachbarschaft ist ungefährlich und jeder grüßt sich. In unmittelbarer Nähe findet man auch einen Supermarkt (Target), der alles führt, was man braucht: Von Unterwäsche bis Lebensmittel. <br/>Wir würden auf jeden Fall wieder bei Myles buchen und können seine Wohnung und ihn als Gastgeber 100% weiterempfehlen."
767606,37623723,2019-10-26,Ideal location to go out and explore the City. Because it’s so central you are right in amongst all the day to day goings ons and the nightlife. Nice easy walks to all the other main streets. Very comfy apartment with all the amenities you could ask for.

Do not panic when you arrive to the building, it is located in a ""bohemian"" street with all kind of people, specially at night. But it is what you expect to find in some places of the Village. However, when you enter the apartment, you are in a special, totally quiet place. You will enjoy your stay...!"

The place had all the space necessary to house 9 people comfortably without feeling cramped, surprisingly for a New York home.  The croissants and cheese she left for our group was exactly the hospitality that makes AirBnBs special and feel at home and not a Hotel. Will definitely be my Brooklyn stay whenever I'm in the area again! Thanks Gladwyn"

Likewise just as Katia was so hospitable, her husband Juan made sure I was happy with everything available in the morning, he offered bread anything that I might want to I have for breakfast that was available from a well-stocked fridge. I had my choice of Kcups (keurig) and regular coffee machine. Everything so convenient nice open door policy. Very flexible hosts."
842136,46779286,2020-12-31,"Tori’s place was great for my last minute extended stay. The apartment was shared with 3 other roommates, but overall was clean and quiet. The rooms are spread out enough to have privacy and keep a safe distance. The toilet of the main bathroom upstairs wasn’t working properly which Tori did advise beforehand, but it did become completely unusable towards the end of my stay. However, the half bathroom was right outside of the room which is located downstairs, so it was convenient and not too much of an issue. The room was spacious and pretty stylish. Good location near the train and other stores. All in all, I enjoyed my stay and would stay again. Thanks, Tori!"

The room with the balcony has nice light and the balcony is big enough to sit with friends before going out.  Marco was very nice, quick to respond to any questions and even shared a home cooked Italian lunch with us. The only caveat is that if you need things to be very clean then the shower might be a challenge."
798885,41133767,2021-08-19,"Mike is a amazing host, very responsive and always close by if needed for anything, Mike made booking a breezy I was having issues on my end and he accommodated me and helped every step of the way and I was able to book and he’s very respectful of your time and space and was even willing to wait to check the apartment after your stay is over to ensure you left so he would not intrude on your personal space. He’s doesn’t overly message you or anything, he kindly makes sure your situated and comfortable and leaves you to your own accord letting you know he’s only a message away if needed. I’ll definitely book again and I recommend Mike place which is well put together and private and has a absolutely amazing shower."

570621,22088301,2021-07-09,"This is great spot. It’s a quiet and quaint neighborhood,  and very close to the subway. It’s nice to have a place in the city with lots of space, and the little backyard was an added bonus-there’s even a cherry tree & blackberry bush back there-the berries were tasty! We stayed nice & cool despite the heat wave happening during our visit. The steps inside are quite steep, and you need to be mindful of them,  but it’s also part of the charm. (Plus, it’s good exercise.) It was a great experience overall, and we would definitely love to stay here again on a future visit."

From the very beginning when I booked the trip, he remained in contact with me and was available to respond to any questions I had. The place was very clean and organized, from the living area all the way to the bedroom ! I can not find one negative thing to say about the experience. He was very kind and always inquired if we were in need of anything at all. This was my first air bnb however when I come back to NY to visit, Geoffery will be the only host I book with!"

781995,39273168,2019-10-21,"From the second I inquired about booking to minutes after I checked out, Jenifer was responsive. Her hosting and customer service is friendly, warm and easy going. She again confirms why I love using Airbnb. I also met her boyfriend who is wonderful as well. They live in the bottom of the space. I can get a feel for a host from their first response. I am never wrong. She's a gem! Check-in and check out were extremely easy. This review is for the master room with the private bathroom. You share the common space and kitchen with guests in the two other rooms that are across from this room. 3 people could easily fit in it. You may not ever see or hear them depending on your schedule. Everyone was nice. Respectful and mindful of noise levels. I was able to open the windows in my room for fresh air. Amazing shower. Great bed. She left some breakfast items as well. It got a bit cold. She adjusted the heat in MINUTES. She even turned it up a bit for me so that it would be toasty for me when I showered in the a.m. without asking. She is magical. I walked to the Ralph Ave train daily. The neighbors spoke. No issues. I was exhausted at night so I took Lyfts back at night from a nearby station because I didn't want to transfer to the A/C trains. I normally was closer to the 2, 3, 4 when in I am returning from other boroughs.  The other guests took transit to and from daily. Jenifer's place is clean, quiet and safe. Thank you for allowing me in your home."

Close to two subway lines, very easy to get most places.  Harlem is a very cool area with lots of good restaurants nearby. Can be a little noisy from neighbours and also water pipes, as it is an old brownstone building. It didn’t bother me but may some. Hosts are friendly and responsive. <br/>I enjoyed my stay and Would happily stay again"

Her apartment is near the subway station and numerous other amenities, including really hip bars and parties in Bushwick. I felt pretty safe in her neighborhood, even walking around at night by myself after an outing. The apartment was always quiet, clean, and I had a lot of privacy staying there for the week I was in NYC. Mamiko is generous with amenities and is quick with replies. Being out and about all day, coming home to the calm apartment was a great feeling. I will always look back at this trip fondly, thanks to the relaxing environment Mamiko provided."

She set the bar high for us and she met all of our expectations. She even went above and beyond! She took a personal interest in our family by engaging with our children, she provided personal touches and accommodations, She was quick to respond to all of our inquiries and she wasn’t intrusive for living right downstairs. The place is beautifully furnished, and had my fiancé wanting us move in permanently haha. It truly was an amazing stay from start to finish. We’re looking forward to getting that spot next time we come down to the Bronx, New York."
610401,24699739,2019-07-15,"Jason is a great, relaxed, and kind host. The flat is nicely furnished, clean, and quite. Its location is amazing and great value for the money. I highly recommend staying with Jason."
689808,30905264,2019-06-18,This gem of an apartment is located in the heart of North Brooklyn. I stayed for two nights and found myself within walking distance of many of the places I had planned on visiting. Check-in was really easy and the hosts were very responsive to messages. The apartment was clean and the bed was very comfortable. It was also much more spacious than I originally anticipated. I hope to have the opportunity to stay here again should the timing work out in the future.
639578,27032162,2020-01-20,This was a cozy little spot. Right near the subway station to get into Brooklyn. Near a few markets and food spots for last minute eats . Teola is a great communicator and went beyond to make sure we were comfortable as well as being available for any questions we had . Thank you again!

685147,30447204,2021-04-09,Beautiful and super spacious house in Bushwick! The tall ceilings and open floor plan on the first level created such a cozy vibe. The deck was a great place to have your morning coffee under the sun too. Kitchen is fully equipped if you want to cook during your stay as well.
698128,31560811,2021-08-01,This stay was great! The apartment is so cute and Daniel is a great host. He is so responsive. The only problem is most of the outlets in the bedroom don’t work so I gonad to buy a power strip so I could charge my phone while the AC was one
845181,47173334,2021-09-03,"This was hands down our favorite vacation rental experience. The place is beautiful, immaculate with a very well-equipped kitchen, comfortable beds and furniture, and in a great location one block from the beach, near restaurants, bakeries, a major grocery, drugstore, and a public library. Hosts always promptly replied to questions. We miss the place already and are hoping to book it again next year. Thank you, Jannah and Moe!"

408266,14429976,2019-02-26,"This was a great location in Williamsburg. Mike was responsive and easy going and we were comfortable in his home. However,  the wall in the bedroom did not reach the ceiling, leaving the top few feet open to the living area so not that private. Mike was very quiet so noise was not an issue but good to be aware of!"
837297,46376967,2021-01-23,Very comfortable I enjoyed my stay :)
709205,32618640,2019-12-14,This is a nice clean place close to subway stations that are just a 20 minute ride into the city!
368065,12642845,2019-03-26,Very roomy for Brooklyn.  On a good street & close to where we wanted to be.  My husband & I were there to visit grandkids.  We did not use coffee setup but got coffee around the corner.  Great for family.

712999,32857674,2021-01-24,I had a very pleasant stay at James and Laureta. They were super responsive and checkin/checkout were smooth. Great place to stay for a few nights in the city.
616140,25071168,2019-07-15,"This garden apartment is on a shady quiet street in an excellent location in Park Slope.  It is convenient to nearly anything you could want and the detailed information Bruce gives his guests is available both online and in print inside the apartment.  The queen-sized bed is comfortable, however quite low to the ground which might be a problem for some people.  The air conditioning (in July) worked very well and provided our ""white noise"" during the night, although could be extra loud at times when cycling on and off. The biggest negative is the strong musty smell upon entering the apartment and particularly in the bathroom which someone with sensitivities may wish to be aware of before booking."
773038,38238758,2020-02-09,"The place is in a great location, it was cle to all the communications right away."
688695,30786946,2019-11-03,Great place with almost all the amenities available. Check-in process was easy. The only issue was of the location accuracy. Both Uber and Lyft rides were unable to properly locate the location on their location services and it dropped us like 1 mile away from the actual place.
613394,24891651,2019-08-10,"Excellent place to stay in NY.  Close to transportation.  Easy to get into the city. And surrounded by everything you would need, coffee spots, restaurants, grocery, late night pizza... Gentry got back to me quickly and was very hospitable.  Definitely would stay again."
460170,16778904,2019-04-21,"Danielle and Joshua's apartment is simply lovely.  The room, location, ease of access is ideal whatever the travel plans.  Subway is a 2 minute walk and grocers, wine shop, pubs, restaurants, etc. the same.  The neighbourhood is very nice.  The apt and location checks all the boxes and then some.  Thank you both for a really lovely stay in your charming home."
754407,36253150,2019-07-11,"Rockaway has the best of everything; from the relaxing day at the beach to the sightseeing of the city. The location of the apartment is minutes from great places to eat, the beautiful beach and the train to the (Website hidden by Airbnb) family walked all over the area exploring the local shops and never felt unsafe..The apartment was excellent; very clean, comfortable and accommodating to my family..They really did a great job including the things you would need to stay there from the coffee pot to the things you would need to enjoy a day at the beach..Sue Ellen and Jr are truly wonderful people that will do what they can to ensure a great experience for their customers..With their vast knowledge of the area/city you are guaranteed to have an amazing experience..We look forward to visiting again.."

241298,6224336,2021-10-15,MIKE IS AWESOME! He is so helpful and communicative and he made our stay so easy. The place is a block from the Metro (and a great coffee shop) and 2 blocks from east river. It’s a quick subway trip to Manhattan but all the peace and quiet of the suburbs! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
740343,35012500,2021-04-27,"Apartment was clean. Bathroom very small. we were unable to make a full 360 degree turn in the shower thats how  tiny it was. The toilet was too close to the wall making it impossible to sit without your knees touching the wall. The mattress on the bed was very uncomfortable. You can feel the springs in your body. The banister and the futon was broken, so be prepared to bring your own blow up mattress.<br/>The front door was always unlocked when we returned to the apartment, even after we securely closed it. <br/>There are several children who live upstairs and makes a great amount of noise throughout the daily, very noisy in the early morning.<br/>Couch was very hard and you sink when you sit. Not much heat in the apartment."
628971,26080646,2019-04-21,Great location

Ночью тихо, спали с открытыми окнами. Есть кондиционер. Рядом есть китайский квартал  с недорогими морепродуктами. Хозяин очень приветливый и дружелюбный. Отвечал сразу без задержек, описал все в деталях. Отличное жильё за свою цену."
312648,9381657,2019-04-26,Had an easy 12 night stay at Sarah's. The apartment is bright and spacious (especially for New York). If you're a light sleeper it can be a bit noisy from the traffic/subway and the boiler is quite loud.<br/>I wouldn't say it's in the coolest part of Williamsburg but I felt safe walking home alone at night and it is so conveniently close to the subway which makes it very easy to get around.<br/>I didn't see Sarah much but she was always friendly and helpful.
167471,3325617,2019-05-24,Great studio located with convenient location

Lot of good restaurants around and a couple of parks. We went to Korean bbq and Karaoke just the next street over. The beds were nice and comfortable,  a/c worked well and there was always hot water. Henry’s communication was the best and they even let us store our luggage free of charge. Would recommend and if ever in NY again I would definitely stay again."
722822,33830012,2021-09-12,"Tom and Reina’s place was absolutely perfect for my trip! I came back to NYC with two other people and we had plenty of room, it was super clean and so convenient. Thank you so much and we will be staying again!"

772732,38215588,2021-11-15,"The place was very close to the Staten Island Railway station which made commuting a breeze. The neighborhood is fairly quiet and there are a bunch of grocery stores and laundry units in the immediate vicinity. The room I had was one of the smaller ones, so make sure to verify that with the host before you book. <br/>Overall, it was a great stay !"
813153,43002696,2021-10-06,Nice and cute apartment in a great location of Brooklyn. So handy to have a proper kitchen
287480,8266641,2019-10-01,"We had a great stay in Anthony’s apartment. Anthony and his cousin Amado are very responsive and kind. Amado checked us in and passed by a couple days later to make sure everything was fine. He lives next door and it was nice to have him looking out for us. We had one unfortunate night when the upstairs neighbor had a loud party and we didn’t think there was anything we could do about it. When we told Amado the next day he immediately went to the neighbor and told them off. So remember Amado and Anthony are ready to help with anything. They were also very patient when we needed extra time for check out. <br/><br/>The apartment is well-located, very clean and spacious for a family- good for our 10 month-old to crawl and play safely. There is a nice park with swings across the street, great restaurants and cafes close by, and the neighborhood is great for a weekend stroll by the iconic brownstones. The Children’s museum is also in walking distance (though closed on Mondays)."
299527,8704528,2019-06-10,"This is exactly what AirBnb is all about. Marjorie is an extremely generous host whose apartment is clean, quiet and right next to public transit. My stay couldn’t have been better. Thank you Marjorie!"

844947,47106347,2021-02-27,The building seems quite old and the entrance is a bit dirty and smells a little but the apartment is good. Also has a good price. Dan is responsive and helped me out when there were some problems. The desk is quite small so if you need a good study space then you might have some trouble. Overall a nice place with good price and the host is definitely nice.
706816,32463145,2019-12-22,I highly recommend!  I couldn’t have felt more at home.
711112,32795950,2019-08-14,Denise is pleasant and accommodating. She responded promptly to messages. The location was perfect for where I needed to be. The bus stop is literally right there.  I would recommend staying with Denise.
701970,31933373,2019-03-18,"Daniel's place looks exactly the same as the pictures. Daniel was there to greet us late in the night to check-in seeing as our flight was delayed and we arrived around 11 pm. Daniel was there to show us around and give us the key to the place. The beds are big and comfy with clean sheets and the temperature of the apartment was comfortable and everything is super clean with a homely feel. Daniel provided water, sodas, and basic amenities. I will definitely rebook with Daniel. The location is central and super close to LGA."

We give George and Diana and their apartment five stars and highly recommend!"
339129,10611168,2020-08-20,"I stayed here for 3 months while looking for a long-term lease in NYC. Great location, quiet neighborhood, and reasonably spacious studio for the price. Property management is pretty responsive and helpful. It’s also nice to have an elevator and laundry room inside the building. Note that gas and electricity will be paid separately (an additional $180-200/month for me), so add that amount to your budget if you’re comparing different options."

876306,50763624,2021-09-27,"The prime city location was great, just downstairs from the apartment are various restaurants, shops, and stores. Central Park west is just blocks away.

Amitai was very responsive to our questions when asked. Highly recommended."
515831,19660760,2019-08-23,"We had a great stay at Maggie's place.  Arverne-by-the-Sea has the best beaches in NYC, and Maggie's lovely apartment is a step away from those beaches.

I highly recommend staying at Kerry's home if you are visiting NY, she is an excellent host!"

825407,44804690,2021-05-12,"Elia’s place was perfect for me. I had to work in the area, drove there, stayed for three nights, and it was a delightful stay... I was gone most of the day, so I would recommend this place for anyone who needs a place to sleep and shower, but wants to be out and about most of the day. The location is basically 2 miles from any downtown districts you’d want to venture to, and about 2 miles from JFK... Everyone gets up early and usually goes to bed at around 10pm or so... Street parking is safe and not an issue at all, the wifi is fast, the water is hot, the room is clean, the house temperature is good, and Elia’s family is kind, courteous and respectful. You feel very safe, and very secure. Elia gives you a house key and room key. No private entrance but I enjoyed interacting with the house guests for 5 seconds, ha. The room is downstairs and they sleep upstairs... Will stay again if I need to."
545367,21038471,2019-01-05,Places was everything I expected love it
650013,27925378,2019-09-22,My family and I spent the weekend at Mat’s place while attending a family wedding in Brooklyn. His place is very comfortable and was spacious enough for the four of us. The neighborhood is safe and quiet. We were able to park right in front of the apartment and left the car there the whole weekend with no issues. His place is within a 10 minute walk to two subway lines which is also great for getting into the city. We would definitely stay with Mat again if we find ourselves in the Brooklyn area.

Very clean, neat and stylish. They have EVERYTHING you need for a long or short stay. They includes so many thoughtful touches. There are even board games etc for a family game night.  Our stay was great. The accessibility for my disabled so was also a super plus.  Thanks again for hosting us!!!  I hope you are available when I need you guys again."
23897,106647,2019-09-03,"Olivia was a wonderful host and everything went really smoothly from booking to check/in to check/out.  She was thoughtful and kindly checked up on us often. Her apartment was clean, spacious, comfortable and in a nice neighborhood. I really liked the fact that her apartment was kids-friendly as I was traveling with a 13-months old. We could feel comfortable as if we are  in our own home. Highly recommended!"
556408,21541423,2019-06-06,"We had a great time at Karen’s house, everything was as described! Check in was easy to do alone, we had instructions from Karen.The house was very very clean and the subway was 5’ on foot!

The bed is super comfy, and there is a full closet and dresser to store your things which would have been amazing for a longer stay. Only wish I had more time to sift through some of his books!"
582434,22632338,2019-01-09,"El apartamento es tal cual las fotos.  Cómodo y a 200mts de la parada del metro. <br/>Tia fue muy atenta desde el principio y hubo una comunicación rápida y respuestas a nuestras inquietudes.<br/>Lamentablemente hubo un inconveniente con el funcionamiento del baño,  que fue solucionado. Ademas le hicimos notar algunas falencias en la limpieza para que pueda corregirlos con su personal. <br/>El departamento y las camas son cómodas y es una opción interesante."
348230,11371535,2020-08-31,"Had a great stay at Donald's place. The room is big and spacious with an antique look. It has an espresso machine, a microwave, and a fridge. The bed is big in size and with clean bedsheets. Donald has an amazing collection of plants on the window side and a beautiful aquarium on one side. The listing is very close to all essentials like laundry, grocery, and take-outs. 5 mins walk to subway 2 and 7 min walk to subway 5. 5 mins walk to the bus stop. Donald is a great host and responds quickly to the msgs. He makes sure your stay is comfortable. I would definitely recommend his place if you're planning to stay in the Bronx."
801071,41490532,2021-10-10,Excellent value and comfortable place to stay. Very clear communication and upfront information. Shera is welcoming and organized and has anticipated guests’ concern really well (it’s a well-oiled machine)!

541478,20886432,2021-07-21,Lidia’s home is an amazing stay in New York! The location is AMAZING! Just a short walk to the 7 train and that takes you straight to Manhattan. Sunnyside is amazing because it’s a quiet and beautiful neighborhood right outside of Manhattan. The house is very nice and very clean! The room was so comfortable. Lidia is a great communicator and is always there to help you whenever you need anything at all. She really makes you feel at home and like family. If you are looking for a quiet stay close to the city in a place that feels like home I would 100% recommend lidia’s beautiful place!

828348,45283030,2021-10-24,"Great hosts. <br/><br/>The location is pretty far from most travel attractions… but this is the compromise for a room at a great price in the area. Moreover, the subway is very close. <br/>Also, the room and the shared kitchen/bath were VERY clean."
548473,21204890,2019-03-04,"Phillip and Sergio are wonderful hosts! Everything went so well. The space was quiet, clean and very comfortable. Lots of great beauty products to use.  You have your own cozy space with your own TV with Amazon Prime, Netflix and more. There is a desk in the room as well so you can work. You control the temperature in your room as well. These guys are so great and so hospitable. I will be back for sure. Great location too! Super happy I chose this place!!!"
655711,28359897,2019-11-01,A really great place to stay! Near the airport and they have quick responses thank you so much!
605255,24306539,2021-03-15,"This is by far the worst experience on Airbnb. Host left instructions to get keys that weren’t there and had to wait for him to come let me in. The place is tiny and cramped up. I had to climb up 3 flights of narrow stairs to get up to the apartment. Not exactly what I call clean and find a bag of weed in the room is unwanted. The kitchen is filthy, never been clean in years even the microwave as the fridge. <br/>But the worst part was that I got sick from the heat in the room that dried the air to the extent I couldn’t breathe and the host explained he can’t shut it and it was controlled by the building. I paid him extra as my wife joined me for alone night although the listing is for 2 guests. My wife was too disgusted and decided that we leave early. I requested from the host to alter the reservation but he didn’t even bother to respond which I find interesting since when I initially made the booking at 3am he responded immediately. Petty attitude."
413684,14726699,2019-03-14,One thing that comes to mind is definitely cozy. It felt as if I was right at home. Shanie will not disappoint you. She helped us from the minute we stepped into New York to the very last day. She’s amazing so I highly recommend booking with her!
691325,31059670,2020-11-20,"Zeta's place is absolutely what you see in the photos. Neat, modern, breathable and just easy to relax and feel comfortable in. Everything you might need is catered for as a fully functioning place while away from home. Zeta is herself prompt and oh so kindly accommodating. It's a quiet unit where you can gather your thoughts or actually get some work done. You can even sit down and write - I found it to be that peaceful. Overall, a great modern comfy place. You won't be disappointed!"
541591,20887028,2019-10-14,It’s about what you’d expect for the area.
668691,29301889,2019-12-05,"Best booking ever on AIRBNB, and we travel a lot! Not simple hosts, but great friends, and this without knowing them before! <br/>The spaces were deeply cleaned and everything was perfect. We even had Netflix and Apple TV. The location is very good and well connected. You got some shops and fast foods near by the house.<br/>Marine and Mathew let us feel like we were home. They even invited us to drink wine with them. They gave us good advice on how to sightseeing and some tips about good restaurants. If we will come back to NYC we are def coming here!"

819118,43790037,2020-08-23,"Amazing location in midtown, right next to k-town and the empire state building. Apartment has practically all you need considering you're spending most of the time enjoying the location."
589262,23219660,2021-11-09,"Cozy room, easy access to public transportation and definitely can’t beat the price."

439236,15835247,2019-03-12,Amanda is a very professional and kind host. We had a really nice room. With some access to the living room and kitchen it was really a great deal. The area here is so safe and has a lively feel with great cafes and restaurants a couple blocks west of there and quick access to central Manhattan and beyond.<br/><br/>Amanda lives in the apartment which is more of an asset than anything else as she is very responsive and interesting.
284477,8135144,2021-11-21,"It was as pictured, and honestly a nice place to stay. Our only complaint was the walls are thin and you can hear everything going on in the apartments around you. You can hear street noise but honestly anywhere you go in the city you will. <br/>Host was very responsive to our concerns and was quick to get back to us"
76258,762145,2020-08-15,"Mariko is honest and caring, unfortunately I did not get to stay due to an error on Airbnbs end..but would have loved to, the help she provided and the understanding she had for my situation was amazing, thank you so much Mariko"
538566,20788473,2021-02-09,"Very nice space, great communication and privacy. This was like a home away from home, very spacious and comfortable we had everything to make our stay complete. I would definitely stay here again."
842997,46923174,2021-06-15,"Solomon did a great job communicating; being responsive and helpful. When Solomon learned from the owner of the building that there was a gas leak, he immediately reached out to Airbnb to secure my cancelled reservation refund and offered help me find alternative housing."
771414,38069091,2020-02-02,"Great place. Great communication from Michael. Simple, easy, and worth every penny. Will rent again!"
760290,36948978,2019-10-08,"Great place to stay for a group. Very spacious, clean, safe and close to subway. Our host was always helpful and available. The beds were comfy, great wifi, nice kitchen and very easy to get to and from the city. We recommend it to everyone."

750616,35808578,2021-07-09,As described
536612,20697209,2020-11-09,"Pros: <br/>Big beautiful apartment, sun drenched space, roof deck, it was convenient for my stay, shabd is kind and easy to communicate with, her cat Ramses is absolutely adorable and sat on my lap while I worked from the apartment. <br/><br/>Cons:<br/>The apartment was dirty. She warned me she wasn’t able to deep clean it for a couple of weeks before I arrived, and gave me a discount as a result.<br/>But it was dirtier than what she warned me of: The mattresses and pillows were super stained, the apartment smelled bad. The cat litter hadn’t been cleaned for easily a week when I arrived. She asked me to bring my own sheets which I gladly did - but the comforter was also torn up and dirty. <br/><br/>The image of the deck in the pictures is not accurate. The couch cushions were completely destroyed and dirty/ falling apart, the chair had no cushions at all.<br/><br/>There are 2 bright lights that shine into in the downstairs bedroom at night. There are no blinds or drapes on any of the windows in the apartment (so if you get dressed to go out at night, you basically have to get dressed in the bathroom otherwise someone will see you naked). She did offer me a piece of cardboard that was under the bed to put up in the window after the first night, which helped a bit, but didn’t cover the whole window.<br/><br/>The cat is so snuggly but also needy. He woke me up almost hourly every night to snuggle, move my arm, scratch me and make biscuits on my back, etc etc. he would snuggle for an hour, then jump off, and start all over again. The first night I put him outside the bedroom door and he scratched and whined at it all night, which was actually more disruptive. It was not easy to sleep  in this apartment. (And I have lived in Brooklyn for years and own a cat).<br/><br/>I wouldn’t recommend a stay here."
662012,28817364,2020-01-09,Jamie’s place was very easy to find very clean I would stay there again
756219,36481615,2019-07-26,The host canceled this reservation 11 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.
384658,13417080,2019-05-31,"Place is perfect, very convinient but sometimes and night there's a lot of noice because of the bar downstairs, or noise neighbors. Besides that the apartment is perfect for those who travel and expect to be most of the time out, it is a block and a half away from the union square park/station and a lot of stores and restaurants around the corner."
338014,10527274,2020-10-11,Had a great stay! Kara and Kevin are great hosts!
432542,15581948,2019-06-17,Great stay in Park Slope! Highly recommend.
638176,26895166,2020-02-12,"One of our best experiences in Airbnb ever... Felt at home since the first moment at this comfy place. Can't tell with words how wonderful is to be hosted by Serenity, she's in every detail to make your stay a delight. <br/>Other aspects:<br/>Location is good and a the subway station is in the corner (the best way to move in NY).  There are a bakery and a market just crossing the street. Many restaurants around.<br/>Neighborhood is nice, we've been walking at almost midnight and felt safe.<br/>This is a no-brainer for singles or couples. If available, just book it! We'd definitely be back."
644851,27528267,2019-05-19,"We had a wonderful stay! The space is very nice, clean, quiet and comfortable, and we had everything we needed.

Rashmi was a great host, extremely responsive and friendly - asking if we needed anything else when we arrived - and included lots of helpful tips and suggestions on local food, etc. Very much recommend!"

208006,4605840,2021-08-08,"This place is an absolute gem and Suzanne is an absolutely amazing host. The apartment has a ton of space and is beautifully designed in a very artistic way. The location is also wonderful and is in walking distance of all the best parts of Brooklyn and also just a few blocks from several subway stations that will take you anywhere you need to go. <br/><br/>Suzanne is really outstanding and went to so much effort to make the environment welcoming. She cooked an amazing breakfast every morning and was lovely to talk to when we crossed paths. She knows New York extremely well and gave great recommendations for things to do.<br/><br/>If you want to spend time visiting Brooklyn, this is the perfect place to stay."

752361,36102578,2019-10-26,"Appartement conforme aux descriptions en plein Brooklyn à 5 min du métro. Il faut compter environ 30 minutes pour rejoindre Manhattan. Très bien décoré, très propre, confortable et fonctionnel avec à l’arrivée des petites touches de service (bouteilles d’eau, chips, capsules de cafés, ...). Nous sommes très content de notre séjour dans cet appartement."
884626,51839779,2021-09-18,"Airbnb pratique car pas tres loin des attractions, les transports en commun sont proches.<br/>Le quartier peut cependant être bruyant la nuit.<br/>Nerlly est très réactive aux messages, et s'assure que tout se passe bien pour vous durant votre séjour.<br/>Je recommande."

691634,31075624,2019-05-27,"Would not have been a very bad if she would have provided the amenities she said. She barely provided anything listed. The place is far off from every tourist spot if you’re going to visit New York. It took almost an hour to go to Times Square,Brooklyn bridge,etc. It is on the 3rd floor of the building with no elevator and initial she promises to help with the luggage but she never does and says “it is heavy”. Cleanliness issues. To sum up she barely knows how to be hospitable."
740898,35059681,2019-10-25,The space is very convenient as it is located a few minutes from LaGuardia airport and the hosts were very flexible since we got into town very late. The space was clean and we enjoyed our stay.

646405,27658203,2019-01-02,"I love their hospitality. Patricia was not there for the first day but her housemate Cherisse welcomed me. Cherisse cooked us breakfast, which I didn't expect when I booked and I was very happy to have meals together with her and another guest. She answered my question with plenty of information. It felt like I was staying in my relatives house. The room was very clean, comfortable and pretty with their artworks. They have 5 cats. Easy access to Manhattan by train. Check-in time is important to them, so you should inform them what time you will arrive."

296065,8608243,2019-07-19,"Devon is an exceptionally kind and gracious host. She dropped off keys for me, and was extremely flexible with the check out time when my parents were having trouble moving out. <br/><br/>Please be aware that this is a 2nd floor walk up. It’s not the fanciest place you’re walking into from the outside but the apartment is cosy. There is a small kitchen space and fridge. Great for two people visiting the city and want to stay in an accessible spot!<br/><br/>Overall, Devon was exceptional! Probably one of the best hosts I’ve had."
538412,20786225,2020-02-17,"Could not have found a better airbnb host! SHE WAS GREAT with telling me exactly how to get in and when etc. We were tired and exhausted the first night we came and were welcomed with a clean room and comfy warm bed. It was our first time to New York and she gave us a handful of great tips and tricks to getting around and what to see. Highly recommend you stay with her. It is safe, cozy, and has a homey feeling with a very nice and welcoming host. Just couldnt have asked for anything more and made our stay in New York a success! :)"

The place was clean, the shower area was INCREDIBLE, and the location being just a subway ride away from the big city was perfect. I’d definitely recommend this spot to any future New York City travelers"

I was easily able to take the L from Manhattan to get to the apartment and check in was simple as well! The apartment was very clean and spacious. Christian also recommended a very nice/delicious Cafe to eat at and it is only a few steps away from his apartment.
667468,29215351,2019-04-22,"Beautiful apartment, well connected with the subway. We spent a great journey in NY! Unfortunatly we did not see Min, the check in and check out is via Keycafe, wich is not really near the apartment by foot but it is not so complicated."

Not to mention, the TV and couch downstairs were HUGE and made for a great hangout spot. Throughout our stay, May was very responsive and helped us right away with any issues that came up. The neighbors were also very friendly and even held a package for us that arrived early before our stay. Highly recommend this Airbnb to anyone visiting or staying in Brooklyn!"
835509,46169618,2021-11-08,"It's hard to be the location of this airbnb. You're so close to the West Village, Union Square, Soho, Greenwich, etc. Everything is very walkable. The building is very quiet and you've got the entire top floor to yourself. Adrianna is also extremely responsive whether through the site or text for any little question."
576487,22356845,2021-04-25,Thank you for a short but great stay! Will definitely be back!
492644,18503701,2021-08-21,"Espacio ideal para alojamiento de una sola persona, que busca no complicarse la vida y con muchas ganas de caminar. Punto a favor de este alojamiento, es que las conexiones de subway o bus, están cercanas."
689810,30905264,2019-06-29,Great location and easy walking distance to the heart of Williamsburg. Plenty of easy transport options for the whole of NYC. Nothing fancy but a really comfortable stay and we hope to return soon.
848975,47544056,2021-07-25,"It was easy to get to this airbnb. There's a metro station 3 blocks away that connects to the red line (which takes you to downtown easily). There are restaurants around the area and even a 24 hour-Mcdonalds 2 blocks away. <br/><br/>The room was a little bit smaller than expected but my friend and I just used it to sleep, take a shower and leave our luggage in a safe place. <br/><br/>Raphael was really nice and considered the whole time!"

363127,12383067,2021-09-13,"I stayed with Alice and Robert for a month and things were just lovely. They were very welcoming from the get-go and eager to give some recommendations that proved worthwhile. They have a unique and thorough history with New York City which was fun to learn about and get ideas for how to explore such a profound city. Their location was fantastic for me; stones-throw to many dining opportunities, museums, access to the the subways and metro services and a quick stroll to Central Park (and a particularly fantastic part of the park as well). <br/><br/>Checking in was a breeze, the space, more than adequate for solo travelers , was cozy and climate cooled with reliable and speedy wifi. The room was tidy and well equipped at check in and access in and out of the building was a piece of cake. They were easy to reach when questions arose. I enjoyed detailing some of the sights seen throughout the trip as so many sights are seen! Communal spaces remained tidy throughout my stay and they were both very accommodating and respectful with requests and sharing their space and time.<br/><br/>If/when I return to Manhattan, I would be thrilled to stay again. <br/><br/>Thanks Alice and Robert for everything!!"
680415,30129734,2020-07-31,"My stay here was perfect. It embodies hospitality and coziness. All you will need during your stay is provided. Essentially, a home away from home. Most importantly, the host has great energy. You won’t regret it."
724127,33907325,2019-08-24,"Sharon & Erika’s place was very delightful. The photos provided were accurate! The location is surrounded by a bunch of local shops and is a 10 minute walk to the 6 train, which made commuting very easy. The Airbnb provided basic amenities for the kitchen, bathroom utilities, and even extra blankets/towels. On the plus side, everything was clean, it felt like I was staying at a hotel. Important to note that check in was seamless as they provided very descriptive instructions on how to enter the building. I would recommend this place to anyone staying in the Bronx!"
517658,19736798,2019-03-20,My stay at Deonisis' was great.  The room was the perfect size with all the amenities that I need.  The location was perfect and the host was very attentive to my requests.  Would definitely recommend!!!
345805,11138823,2019-11-29,"I want to preface my review by saying, anyone who has anything negative to say about their experience with Shully’s AirBNB did not read the house rules and were not being respectful of the space.<br/><br/>I arrived promptly at 2pm and was greeted by her husband who had a street parking space waiting for me and gave me a tour of the space.<br/><br/>Hosts: Shully and her husband were very sweet. Shully was always easy to reach and quick to respond to inquiries.<br/><br/>The space: looks exactly as pictured. It was extremely clean and well organized. There were many toiletries available for use and a fridge with juice, water and basic sustenance. There was no issue with heat—as a guest I had the ability to control the climate in the unit which was nice. <br/><br/>Parking: Shully offered a parking spot, which is amazing, considering my parking experience in New York being limited to street parking. If you have a car (something of a Toyota Camry size or smaller), she’s more than willing to accommodate. There is also street parking.<br/><br/>Overall, I would definitely recommend Shully’s space to anyone! I’d book again for sure."

Nos tocó estar al final del verano y fue hermoso. Está ubicado muy cerca de varias estaciones de metro, se puede llegar al Central Park y los museos que lo rodean, a Time Square o cualquier otra zona de Manhattan en 25 minutos máximo.  Es un barrio muy tranquilo rodeado de avenidas y centros comerciales con lugares muy lindos para cenar o tomar una copa, nuestro preferido fue el Bar Tabac, recomendado por nuestros anfitriones. Se puede llegar caminando al Brooklyn Brigde Park y a Dumbo, desde donde se tienen unas vistas hermosas de la gran ciudad. Es la oportunidad para recordar que Nueva York no se termina en Manhattan y que del otro lado del puente hay mucho para descubrir."

638856,26980415,2019-11-08,"Donnihe’s place was nothing less than “home away from home” for us. Not only the place was better than we expected, it was also full of freebies for us to try, clean towels and robes, water and drinks, etc. Donnihe and his family welcomed us and guided us around the city, recommended wonderful places to eat and things to do in the neighborhood. The location is perfect, next to the best subway line in NYC, the M line which gets you everywhere. After a full day at the city, it is nice to go back to a neighborhood that is quiet and safe. I would totally recommend staying at Donnihe’s, I will surely do so again in the future."
50146,405025,2019-11-25,"Being away from my daughter for the last four years as not been easy.  However, my daughter has an inspiring career and she loves residing in Astoria!

Thank you so much!!!"

Jackson Heights has such great food all around, and Karen gives so many amazing recommendations in her house manual upon arrival. Her place is about 30 minutes from the city via Subway, but it was really easy to get there and back. I would book with Karen again in a heartbeat!"

635608,26747248,2019-06-02,"Roberto’s Studio offers all the essentials.  Located just a block away from a city bike depot, I found bicycling to the subway or some days all the way along the water and across the Brooklyn Bridge the best way to start my day.  Comfortable, quiet and private.   Some ruff areas in the surrounding neighborhoods but I didn’t have any issues.  Perfect affordable accommodation with great hospitality if your open to a little commute."
535994,20678811,2021-08-29,"It is a very nice and comfy place to stay and Hya is a great host! Although a little far from main attractions of the city, there are definitely really good restaurants around and if you will be in the city whole day touristing, it is a nice spot to go back to! The most important factor in the house is Hya I guess! She is the best host you could have. Makes you feel welcomed and lets you enjoy your stay. It was a great value for the price I paid here! I recommend it to everyone"
582725,22665286,2019-04-28,Everything was exactly as expected and our overall stay was pleasant. Antonis was helpful when we inquired for support. The default available wifi was quite slow and we had to request to have the modem activated resulting in additional fees.

360130,12221970,2019-08-05,"This houseboat is as beautifully done as it appears in the pictures, but unfortunately Ben's listing is not up to date. The pictures are not current. The following things are worth noting:<br/>1. There is no furnished roof deck.<br/>2. The boat is on land (as mentioned in the listing), but overlooks a car impound lot.<br/>3. The boat is so close to JFK that you can see the planes at the gate. Bring ear plugs!<br/>4. There are no curtains, at least not in one of the bedrooms and in the living room. This means no privacy, not even to put on pajamas. But also, there are EXTREMELY bright security lights in the marina that shine directly in to the upstairs bedroom. It might be better in the downstairs bedrooms, but that is the one that we preferred. Bring eye masks!<br/><br/>I'm honestly not sure how no one has mentioned any of these things in a previous review. However, Ben was accommodating when we decided we wanted to leave after one night instead of three. For that reason, plus the fact that the boat is very beautiful, I have given 3 stars."

A 2 min walk to the train station and 6 min walk to soho, Nolita, and 10 min walk to Tribeca! The neighborhood felt so safe day and night! She also gives the best tips on food, and things you must do in New York for example museums. I was able to experiance the New York thanks to Chewie! From going into attractions for free!!!

While I did enjoy my stay, and Don is a wonderful host(even helped me being my stuff to my van when I left), I ended my reservation early because:<br/> 1.) Their house rules are very strict<br/> 2.) His friend Peter is a terrible, terrible person. Literally a monster. If you stay here, do your best to avoid him because if you end up getting in his way, or light a candle of a scent he doesn't like etc. he will be irritated and he will let you know. He's a very hostile person, and I feel bad that Don has to deal with him everyday. Best wishes Don and thank you for letting me stay at your place!"
578525,22440046,2019-12-08,The hosts are lovely people and the location is great for the LES. They were gracious and accommodating. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. It would have been helpful to know that there is smoking in the apartment.

She responds quickly, is most accommodating, and when we needed help she was right there for us.  <br/><br/>The room is spacious and comfortable, and we loved having our own bathroom.  <br/>You are about 2 blocks to the N W trains which is the perfect location.  There are many food options - including a Trade Fair store - within a block.  <br/>You'll have access to a kitchen if you like to cook, which was something we were looking for during our longer stay.<br/><br/>The building is newly remodeled and we really loved our stay. I would give her 10 stars as she was a fantastic host.  <br/><br/>When we come back, we will be looking to stay here again.<br/><br/>Thank you, Karen!!"

750626,35808578,2021-08-14,"Host was very nice, greeted me when I got there, gave me a bottle of water and told me there was ice in the fridge, generally very hospitable. Cute little kitchen area to eat in (no eating in the room). Everything was very clean and organized. Only small thing, the ac in my room didn't work too well so it got pretty warm, and I wasn't able to connect to the wifi (in fairness it was a short stay so I didn't ask her about it, otherwise I'm sure it could have been cleared up).<br/>All in all, a very pleasant experience, I will definitely consider staying here for future trips."

The location of this place is about 7-10 minutes walk to the 7 train Main Station, and the way from station to the apartment is very safe. I like the location because it is close to a lot of restaurants and markets. The place is very clean and stylish, I really like the design of the bedroom.

757104,36601571,2021-10-12,"I had a great stay here! Quite literally the only issue I had was the stairway. Any guests with handicap like mine, I would suggest another location simply because the stairs are very, very wide with one railing. I have Cerebral Palsy and I was struggling the whole way with balance each and every time. There’s multiple flights of stairs, although the staff will assist with suitable accommodations nearby if needed.  They’ll carry your bags in directly to your room which is a great help as mine was extremely heavy from the strap. I traveled alone so I didn’t feel cramped at all in this room! It’s quite spacious. I stayed in the premium king. The bed was a great size for me—I slept safely and soundly. <br/><br/>The bathroom floors are heated and there are two shower heads, with a second heater ventilation overhead. You’ll love that for the winter months.  You’ll be given a sign for the door so as not to disturbed if sleeping or otherwise occupied. The location itself was walking distance from a lot of restaurants, cafes, and markets, and there’s always free food and other events going on in the city (not affiliated with the hotel stay) should you choose to participate which I really appreciated. You’ll get the chance to keep the old-school camera that is there in the room for $130. Beware that you’ll be charged upon check-in as well. All in all, I really, really liked this place and I missed New York even more."
749080,35650240,2019-07-31,Great stay! Roommates are great. The one in the room by the bathroom took me on a date to Chinese Tuxedo. Restaurant 10/10<br/>The guy 10/10
613411,24891651,2021-07-25,Gentry was a lovely host! Her apartment is very close to the NW subway station and the neighborhood was quiet and had lots of good food/bars around. Would definitely stay again if I came back to New York!
617295,25138442,2020-08-12,Ms.Irina’s place was amazing. It’s a very big studio apartment with a huge ceiling. I really enjoyed staying here. It’s a super safe. I would definitely stay here again.
686773,30593915,2021-09-23,"I HIGHLY recommend this place to travelers who are looking for a comfortable stay. Vicky is very straightforward and clear with instructions and everything you need for your stay. It’s a safe and quiet environment, and I enjoyed my stay."
813579,43044085,2020-11-23,An amazing amazing host !!!!! The apartment was super clean! Quiet house. Only 10 minutes car drive from the upper east side of Manhattan. Daniel helped us with literally everything. He answered us always within minutes. And was so helpful. Loved his place and would come back anytime
760453,36974600,2021-08-30,"Delores is probably the most gracious host we've ever had in all the time we've been AirBnB customers - she is a delight. The house was clean and has a very well appointed kitchen. On a clear night you get a beautiful view of the city. It was perfectly located for our purposes - about 45 minutes to drive to Manhattan (depending on traffic of course!), a few minutes from the beach and our relatives, about an hour to get to Port Washington/Minneola. The wifi and tv options worked well. It was a very good value and suited our needs just fine."
378518,13216357,2019-09-30,Great place! Mary was very quick to respond as well.
427346,15423731,2019-11-21,"What a wonderful home! Andrew has created a really wonderful space that is a joy to stay in.<br/><br/>From the spacious kitchen with the island, high ceilings and original features, the whole place has been lovingly renovated.<br/><br/>The area is great and Andrew recommended some cool spots nearby too. <br/><br/>Myself and my partner would love to stay again."
524738,20135361,2020-09-02,"Cameron & Dione’s place is in a vibrant neighborhood with fantastic views, ease of access to the rest of the city, and lots of local spots to eat, grab groceries, etc - even during COVID. We loved our stay and highly recommend this place!"
751857,36039490,2021-09-18,"Very clean, comfortable, and quiet. We enjoyed being able to walk to the nearby shops for our morning and evening beverages,  plus snacks and newspapers. Great location!"
657921,28483571,2019-12-04,"Really enjoyed the stay here. Our host responded extremely quickly to all of our questions and was very accommodating to us. The home is equipped with all of the basics you need and is perfect for hosting a large group. We had a 1.5 year old with us and the space was excellent for her as well, as she had a lot of freedom to move around without ever getting hurt. This airbnb is located close to the bus and is only about a 7 minute walk to the subway - local and express options available- and the Long Island Railroad  (this subway station also has an elevator which is helpful if you’re using a stroller). The airbnb is also about a 5 minute walk away to a large grocery store and different stores (like Dunkin’ Donuts, dollar general) which was very convenient.  The space is sleek and modern, the floors are gorgeous, and the TV (equipped with Netflix and other channels) and large sofa is a huge plus as everyone was able to relax comfortably. We found the beds comfortable and the sheets/blankets provided were cozy. We also loved the keyless entry... we never had to be afraid of losing a key. This unit also has heating which is a must have in NYC in the winter, our host was very accommodating with turning the heat higher when requested as well. We would definitely stay here again."
667925,29230470,2019-09-19,The place was continent and was clean!
806985,42311578,2021-09-26,"This is the place! Great location, beautiful neighborhood and wonderful host. Mathieu and his place were awesome. We will be staying here again any chance we get!"
708398,32554699,2021-10-31,"Si bien el precio no es para ser tan exigentes, habia ruidos a toda hora en la noche, el olor a cigarro a ratos era bastante fuerte e impedía descansar tranquilos, a ratos había discusiones en otras habitaciones y era bastante incómodo en general.<br/><br/>El barrio tranquilo y el baño lo suficientemente limpio pero la verdad no creo volver"
500700,18908490,2019-07-28,Nice host，nice apt，great location.<br/>What you see is exactly what you get.<br/>Thanks Jeffrey and his friend John，who tidied up the apt before we arrival.The apt is coay ､well designed and very convenient location!  We really have a great time here！Thanks！

752388,36102578,2020-03-11,"Nice, clean, comfortable apartment, that worked well for our family of three. Everything we did was in Manhattan, so this location was a bit further out than we anticipated. We were not that familiar with NY geography, but we are now! The subway station for the J line was a 3 minute walk from the property, so that was very convenient. We are suburbanites, who drive everywhere, and were not that comfortable walking back from the subway late at night. It is a short walk and probably would not bother most people."

787490,39837248,2021-05-09,"Community felt safe. <br/>Room is super small. Parking is terrible, plan to walk blocks from space. <br/>Bathroom cleanliness was subpar. <br/>If you need to rest/sleep this is not the spot for you. The tenant or guest in next room was on the phone ALL night/midnight. I could not sleep."
755940,36455649,2019-08-21,"Hi. Ummm I very seldom write poor reviews - if ever. This is the worst airbnb I have stayed in. I don't know how this property is a super host. There are roaches all over the kitchen. Whether or not you get the place sprayed regularly, it's a problem. The bathroom smelled like urine and was in desperate need of a clean. Like - was dirty. Floors were dirty. Toilet was dirty. The room I stayed in had a FAN. Not an AC, which the listing claimed it had. Big difference. It was hot and kind of panic-inducing being in that room because of the lack of circulating air. The security was nice in terms of all the keypads on the doors. But seriously - this place is messy and looks like a halfway house. I would not stay again."
401681,14103889,2019-10-09,The house was such a surprise. So comfortable and spacious. The beds were so comfy and that reclining sofa was so comfortable that there a few disagreements about who sat there.<br/><br/>Great kitchen and bathroom facilities. The host was so accommodating and responded quick to any questions. We'd definitely recommend this to any group wanting a nice neighbourhood to stay in.

746558,35459644,2021-09-02,"We arrived almost an hour after check in time and the place still wasn't ready. The cleaning people were still there and we had to awkwardly wait in the hallway for a bit. Jean's boyfriend came and explained the locks during this time. The place smelled strongly of Marijuana and we had to wait while he accused the cleaning staff of smoking. It was a little awkward after a busy travel day.  When we finally got to go in , the place wasn't that clean and there were still dishes in the dishwasher. Half of the towels smelled of mildew. I think they would benefit from a new cleaning service.  We had to clean up the place ourselves somewhat, which was disappointing for the price. The place is nice otherwise and in a fabulous location. We were able to walk to several restaurants and cute little markets. Easy subway access. It feels super safe. There are only 2 AC units in the place so we were forced to sleep in one room due to extreme heat. Had we known this we definitely would have stayed somewhere cheaper or a place we could fully utilize. We didn't interact with the Host much but her boyfriend was helpful and nice."
627373,26009952,2019-08-25,"Great, clean, spacious 1 BR apartment in a very convenient area. Excellent communication. Highly recommended."

The line of communication wasn't always clear or accurate with Gerald and it took some extra effort to understand logistics, but overall Gerald was accommodating and I'm glad I stayed at his apartment."
877460,50913858,2021-08-08,"it was more than what I expected. in the middle of Harlem and the neighborhood was entertaining lol the neighbors seem cool and not far from the subs, a real culture area. I did get confused on exactly which entrance as my entrance but its literally in the corner and you do have to go up a huge flight of stairs so don't pack heavy like I did lol but once inside its a real dope view and the decor is great! super clean ( a few slippery spots on the floor like wax feeling so be careful when wearing socks but they bed is probably the most comfortable beds in been in ! I will definitely come back and not far from central park too !"
323620,9826628,2020-03-17,"Louba has been the best host, her son and her made us feel like home from the first day.

33629,201992,2019-05-11,"We love our experience with Andrea and her place. All things were very nice and friendly. We like the style of interier. We visited  NY with our toddler, so it was a great choice to stay at Park Slope of Brooklyn. The area is full of playgrounds, parks are about 15-20 min by walking. Everything in the place is working very good. The toddler found toys inside the place, she loved to<br/>play with. We found nice library inside with pohotobooks of great photographers. The hospitality are great, we felt like we stayed at the place of the very best friends. It was nice and very friendly to provide very good and fresh food (granola, milk, eggs, butter and some other things), we arrived around 8pm and it was a great help to manage our first meal. We are<br/>lucky to meet Andrea and her family! Thank you very much!"

It was much more spacious than I thought after viewing the pictures the bathroom is lovely, the kitchen is beautiful, and there fantastic fires of the big city from every single window. My fiancé and I had a blast and our host Melissa responded to any questions immediately and effectively. We had absolutely no problems with check in or check out and really enjoyed our stay."

682040,30252034,2019-07-27,"Very clean room. The room is not big but good for me. The bed is of good size and comfortable. Two wifi networks - one is normal speed, the other is too slow. As I only used the wiki at midnight (with the normal speed one), it was good. Provide free bottles of water (in a small refrigerator) - appreciated! 7 mins from the subway station. Good location - safe and clean. People are nice and friendly. If I would visit Manhattan uptown next time and if Ester's place would be available, I would do it again."

284447,8135144,2019-06-21,"We stayed there for 10 days and enjoyed the apartment and the location so close to time square,  bus terminals,  and train station.  Vapee was very good to communicate and corporative. It is excellent for 4ppl... We had a great time.  You will save a lot compare to hotels. Lots of restaurants once you get down,  easy to get a cab.  Location is the plus point."
880422,51265152,2021-09-26,"Great place, especially for a long stay.  Ms. Tracy’s apartment was spacious, super clean, and the kitchen & house was packed with everything we needed to enjoy our 3 weeks in Brooklyn.  Ms. Tracy was very communicative and checked-in with us regularly to make sure we had everything we needed.  <br/><br/>We enjoyed the neighborhood very much and found the locals to be very friendly.  There’s a lovely park within walking distance and the 3 line subway will take you straight into Prospect Park, Brooklyn Heights, and Manhattan.  The Caribbean influence in this Brownsville area is strong!  Lots of jerk chicken, ox tail, goat curry, and other delicious Caribbean flavors at local spots.  Plenty of grocery options just a couple blocks away and authentic, classic NY pizza pie at Tony’s, right next to the subway.  <br/><br/>Overall we very much enjoyed our time at Ms. Tracy’s in Brownsville and we wouldn’t <br/>hesitate to stay there again."

388146,13558030,2021-09-12,"Good value and easy location next to the 7 subway. I felt safe walking from the subway to the airbnb, at night, by myself. A basic room, but bed was comfy, a/c worked, and mini fridge came in handy."

699570,31715312,2021-07-07,"The loft/apartment itself is as advertised - enough space to lay your head and have a comfortable and quiet place to rest, refresh, shower, and then head out into the city.  <br/><br/>Be warned that 31st street felt a bit grittier than I remember it.  Each evening there were men gathered on the corner of 31st & Broadway in an altered state.  (They did not bother us, but it was uncomfortable.)   It was clear, also, that local businesses were behind on getting their garbage bags removed.   However, GREAT access to Herald Square subways and Midtown.  <br/><br/>Hard to beat the price."

594662,23597076,2019-04-07,"Everything is good about this house and is in the basement of Milton's. Apartment is very isolated and quiet and no noise except for the heater and some footsteps from upstairs. Area is rather safe, though I encountered some schizophrenic people on the streets who might be crazy, but they are harmless. There are lots of food, groceries, delis, and restaurants within walkable distance. Parking was really easy (either on the streets or the driveway). Cooking in the apartment was a breeze as it has all the basic amenities, but the smoke detectors are really sensitive so be careful. The 2 train is a few blocks away and the Bx8 is one block away to transfer to the 5 train, Bx26, or even Bee-Line towards Westchester. Checkin and out was really simple as Milton was very responsive and made my stay a very enjoyable one. There were simple snacks and breakfast in the fridge, including eggs, croissants, donuts, etc... (Just make sure to check expiry dates). I was also prrovided with a few bottled water and it was a nice touch. If you're staying for long, trash is really easy to handle too. Overall, this is the best experience I've had using AirBnB and Milton did a great job hosting me. I would definitely come back again next time."
621289,25460977,2019-02-17,"Isaacs place is exactly as it’s listed, photos are super accurate. It’s so easy to get on the Subway and get around New York, convenient for shops and laundry. The apartment is really secure and quite spacious, and it’s nice to come back to after a long day. Isaac is personable, funny and a great host! Kept us updated throughout the stay, and was really easy to get a hold of if we needed anything. Would definitely recommend Isaacs place if you want something out of the hustle and bustle, and would stay again!"
268581,7516218,2019-12-22,"Overall we had a wonderful stay at this apartment. We were in NYC for work for about two months and it was great to have a nice place with full kitchen to come home to. It looks just like the pictures (I know some comments say the art is different but that wasn’t the case for us). It’s a five minute walk to the York street subway station so easy to get into Manhattan. The kitchen was my favorite part - it’s fully stocked with knives, pots and pans, coffee making stuff and a dishwasher. Keep in mind that you’ll need to pay for apartment cleanings every 2-3 weeks (~$100) but it’s very easy to coordinate when the cleaning lady comes."
673828,29776797,2019-07-03,"This is an amazing place for the price in NYC. It's HUGE for an NYC apartment, and was perfect for our group of 5 - everyone pretty much had their own bed/room. The subway directly across the street gets you anywhere you need to be in about a half hour.  The host met us at the apartment for check-in and showed us around, showed us how to use the keys/locks, and gave us good neighborhood recommendations for things close by (such as a supermarket a block and a half away that we may not have found otherwise).  The place is very safe and secure, there's a gate that locks and two subsequent doors with deadbolts. We couldn't have asked for a better stay."

207896,4604991,2019-09-09,"We had a great stay at Luis and Victor’s place! The room was very clean and the bed was really comfortable, which was perfect after long days of exploring the city. Both are great host and do their best to accommodate you and make sure you feel at home. This was our first time staying in a shared apartment and they made it easy to want to do it again!<br/><br/>The apartment is only 0.2 miles from M and J train which takes you right to the city, about 30 minute ride. I highly recommend to anyone looking for a cozy place to stay in NYC."

701020,31881052,2020-01-26,"We didn’t spend as much time in the apartment as we intended, ended up only having time to sleep and check out. But the place was clean, had everything it promised. My biggest issue came with communication. Immediately after booking my reservation (a few months in advance of my trip) I sent a message asking for a delayed check out due to flight time. And for at least 2 months after me following up there was no response until I threatened cancelling the reservation. After that, I got a response and communication there on out was better because it was now close to the time of the trip. The keys are in a lockbox so check in isn’t difficult, they just have to provide you the lockbox code. Overall, it was fine, you just shouldn’t have to threaten to cancel to get an answer. I didn’t even care what the answer was, I just expected a timely response."

840288,46563687,2021-07-11,"This was a really good spot away from the city, more of a suburb type layout of the area. Good area, didn’t get my car broken into, wish the layout was better, this spot is located in a basement, not a good cell phone signal down there, was also a bit hot but they did provide fans in each room, You do hear plans as it is 5-10 mins from the airport. Decent spot for the price."
528061,20242938,2019-09-20,One of the best thing was he replies immediately of text messages. We had great time and it was close to subway

The apartment is very spacious and well equipped: great utensils, pots and pans in the kitchen, enormous amount of storage space in the bed room, excellent washing machine, dishwasher and dryer,  great projector  Apartment is conveniently located near an underground station (max 5 minute walk) which will bring you to Manhattan in about 30 - 50 minutes. Walking distance to hip places in Brooklyn as well. The neighbourhood felt very safe. Check in and out instructions are very clear and and communication went very smoothly. I would highly recommend this place!"
647941,27733012,2021-09-29,"Cozy room. Toilet bowl was very dirty, looked like poop stains when we checked in and it stayed that way when we checked out. It's easy to get in and out. Once you check-in, they stop responding to your request. I asked for an extra pillow and they completely ignored me but were quick to remind me about checkout. It's a very self help space, as long as you don't need anything from the host the stay is alright."

678955,30046573,2020-02-01,"Such a quirky little gem of a place this is. The pictures don’t do it justice as it’s so much more fabulous and wonderful in person. The location is incredible and Susana and Ricki are very thoughtful hosts. <br/><br/>My only tiny nit was the heat, I tried opening the windows I could but it was still a bit of an oven. Obviously this is up to the building. Could have been the opposite problem which wasn’t the case :)"

431974,15561163,2021-11-13,"Nos quedamos por segunda vez en el departamento de Michelle, en todo momento ella muy amable como siempre. Lo que necesites ella responde rápidamente. El departamento está a muy pocas cuadras del subte que te lleva a Manhattan. Hay lugares de comida y tiendas cercanas al departamento. Volvimos en un clima fresco y siempre está prendida la calefacción y tenes opción de prender una calefacción más si aún tenes frío ( no la necesitamos)."

835031,46124981,2021-05-17,This place was ok. I recommend bringing your own towels and bedding. There was Lysol wipes in the kitchen. I suggest wiping down the couch with them before sitting down. <br/><br/>The neighbors can be quite loud at night but you do not hear them if you close the bedroom doors. <br/><br/>Plenty of street parking.
561728,21730735,2019-06-24,"Like others have stated, you get what you pay for. Room is shared with 3 other rooms. That's not a huge deal however, this particular room is situated next a set of creaky common stairs that everyone uses and can hear people coming up and down them all hours of the night. Also hear the door's keypad beeping everytime they come in and out. Many knats flying around as well. Room was made nicely and comfy bed besides the rock hard pillows. Bathroom was also clean."
504949,19102027,2019-02-18,"This apartment is very well positioned in Williamsburg with great food and drink spots all around. L train to Manhattan is nearby. The room is well kept and the bed is comfortable. The bathroom is a little small and could be a little cleaner but not a deal-breaker. There is a lot of noise from the street but headphones or earplugs will block most of this out. Overall a very easy stay, Aika and Maxime made everything very fuss-free for check in and check out. I would recommend."
581342,22567430,2019-07-14,Awesome place
884660,51841384,2021-10-24,The studio worked great for a couple nights and well located. The only thing was we did not get a fob to enter the building so we had to buzz/call him every time.
144453,2267177,2021-10-26,"Skippy was a very kind and accommodating host, great to talk to and always helpful when we had questions, needed help or wanted to chat. His cats are very sweet, his home is charming and authentic and felt like staying with a relative. Quiet with a nice outdoor space, a good amount of space in the room and bathroom right next door. The stairs are steep and narrow so if you have mobility issues or lots of luggage that is something to consider, but nothing out of the ordinary for 100 year old New York row homes. Two short blocks from the train, easy to get to most places around Manhattan and Brooklyn in 30-45 mins any time of day, and lots of restaurants nearby. Sunset Park is a fun and interesting neighborhood with cool things to check out very close by. Glad we stayed here and looking forward to staying with Skippy again!"

The place is safe and quiet to have a good sleep. Sandra is very friendly, glad to talk with.<br/>房间采光好，有空调和风扇。风扇基本没噪音，晚上睡觉可以开很舒服。有书桌可以使用笔记本，对于工作和视频都很方便。有壁橱可以挂/晾衣服，夏天+风扇干的很快。卫生间略小，但提供的东西很齐全。卫生方面，相对住过的其他Airbnb，这个干净一些。公寓地理位置很好，不在商业街因此很安静，但离得又不远，觅食很方便。房东人很热情，随和，易于沟通。"

419412,14982260,2020-11-11,"This is the best Airbnb. I’ve stayed in quite a few, and I think it’s fair to say that this one ranks the highest. Adrian has thought of everything you need and even labeled all the essentials around the apartment. Communication was clear. Renting a car spot for an extra fee was clutch. The location is perfect for access to both the grand central and to get on a train and hope into manhattan. There are supermarkets and laundromats nearby. There is even a small outside space to sit and have early morning coffee. Highly, highly recommend booking this Airbnb."

199690,4359718,2020-03-05,Really good place in a great area of Brooklyn. Had a good time staying here and the closeness of the subway was a great benefit.
788427,39873694,2020-01-20,Great location with nearby restaurants and easy access to multiple subway lines.  Great for a large group as it is hard to find places in NYC with this many bedrooms.  The apartment is clean and well maintained.
735688,34511726,2019-12-30,"I was so pleased with this stay. Zahira and her cohost are very responsive and friendly.  The apartment is so beautiful and clean, I didn’t want to leave. <br/>It’s located close to a lot of transportation and stores. They also left menus and a map which was  a really nice touch. <br/>Thanks for everything"
669729,29453598,2019-06-01,Tohars place is well located close to a subway station with lots of interesting sights in Brooklyn close by.

779311,38980221,2021-03-28,"Kristopher's space is in a beautiful location close to Saratoga Park which has a nice playground and also a short oval path ideal for strolls. It is a beautiful, quiet street. The space itself has a lot of timber and warmth to it, and a lot of original details are preserved. The backyard space is a wonderful asset also. It is ideal for a solo traveler but can also accommodate a small family or pair. <br/><br/>Kristopher was also very communicative and helpful."
827416,45192663,2021-05-24,"Absolute gem of a space! Not only is this the heart of one of the best authentic neighborhoods to explore..the room is an exceptionally quiet and clean retreat whenever you need a break. Jasmine was very kind, accommodating and easy to talk to. Recently renovated, the unit feels brand new which is refreshing to see while traveling on a budget. Highly recommend."

489431,18358606,2019-12-31,"Lovely little apartment, I travelled with 3 members of my family and this was ideal. Subway a few steps away and a supermarket straight across the road . Would defo use Kate’s place again when returning to NYC ."
760361,36963544,2019-08-19,"Jacqueline was so lovely to me & my partner, this place is close to a lot of fast food restaurants and bus service is right at the door step. Jacqueline & her husband made sure that everything was intact and she also gave me a bottle of champagne, fruits and so much water. I will definitely be staying when I’m back in New York. <br/>Thanks a lot Jacqueline"

Smiling and kind neighbors, clean apartment with humble decoration, no WiFi or equipment problems. Very convenient. People who need sun light,  terrace may be a little bit uncomfortable but we did not bother. Host was very helpful, flexible."
622110,25538397,2019-11-24,great location and a beautiful place
171924,3522244,2019-07-26,Brad’s place is great because it’s super convenient & the value is great. We stayed for a little less than a week & had no complaints. The A/C worked great in the little room (there was a heat wave with temps of 100F while we were staying there) so we were very grateful for this. Brad is a responsive & unobtrusive host- there were many times we weren’t even sure he was staying there with us- but there when we needed him.
464331,17093180,2019-03-12,Great communication. Even bought me pizza on arrival
565740,21877805,2020-06-08,My friends and I enjoyed very much our stay at Alexandra's apartment. It was exceptionally clean and properly equipped. We felt like home. Thank you Alexandra for the outstanding hospitality. Looking forward To our next visit in NYC.

597170,23728057,2019-05-16,"Very nice place, big bedrooms and living room.<br/>The whole flat was very clean and Chester a great host."
534359,20639628,2019-07-29,"Great room, didn’t expect it to have a tv which was a plus. Be mindful you may have to share bathroom with other guests. Overall great place to stay, I would recommend."
545655,21054012,2019-05-20,The space was as described and Aston is a great host!
861223,49192576,2021-09-16,So this place is wonderful and there were a few minor things that I’ll mention but overall I would definitely stay here again.<br/><br/>The first and only major issue is the parking situation. It took about an hour every night to find parking  it’s awful. There’s also a big issue with double parking in the area. So please be mindful of that. I was told by various people that in Jewish areas of the city this is a common occurrence because parking is limited and people take going to their place of worship seriously so they’ll have no issue double parking. So just be mindful of that usually we could find spaces when school was starting if that helps.<br/><br/>The apartment gets very hot even if the curtains are closed but there is a fan there. I ran it for the majority of the time I was in the Machel’s home to keep the air cool and flowing. I’d recommend putting the fan on in the bedroom prior to going to sleep so it’s comfortable.<br/><br/>The couch was broken when I got there but Machel was wonderful by letting me know in advance so my friend sat on the bean bag (it was a dream come true for them lol) while I sat on the couch and watched tv. She did mention that she had already ordered a new one but it wouldn’t be there until after I left so this issue should be resolved for any of you reading this.<br/><br/>Overall the apartment is spacious and it really did feel like home. There is AMPLE closet space so you should have no trouble having a place to put your clothing. <br/><br/>The Airbnb is an hour ride away if you’re taking the train and about 40 minutes from Coney Island. I found getting to and from the train station pretty easy and felt safe walking alone at night in the area. I walked outside alone a few times between 11:00pm-4:00am and there were often families and young couples walking around and police cars driving around. <br/><br/>I would definitely recommend this listing to anyone looking to come to New York Machel was very responsive and always took initiative to keep me in the loop before I could even think to ask her something.
130821,1865336,2019-01-23,the best Airbnb experience I’ve ever had
826878,45117459,2021-07-08,"clean, charming and very functional space! its very enjoyable and very close to the beach"

577323,22389296,2021-09-12,"What you see and read is what you get with this host. It is a great value.  No frills, not fancy or overstated.  I loved sitting on the balcony in the warm sun after getting settled.  The place was neat as a pin, quiet, easy to access and met all my needs in every way.  Yves was kind, considerate and responsive to my questions and communications.  You won’t go wrong if what you see and read is what you want. I recommend it."
356787,11940117,2019-08-08,La estancia fue muy confortable. El alojamiento dispone de todo lo necesario. Bien comunicado.
466040,17147561,2019-06-12,"Prime location (as pictured) with easy subway access, friendly and accommodating host, super comfortable bed, interesting and wonderful people, and generous amenities.  Definitely a place to visit again!!  Thank you, Joe!"
675859,29900966,2021-02-04,This railroad apartment feels a bit like an old opera theater. The curtains dividing the rooms could be curtains from a stage. <br/><br/>The noise from the street and hallway come into the space very clearly. I was woken up one morning by a profanity laced argument that sounded like it was right outside my door.
688675,30786946,2019-08-11,Communication was immediate throughout the process. Check in was very convenient and easy. The apartment was clean and welcoming. Would stay again when needing to spend a night near JFK.
678338,30007128,2019-10-14,Gréât place to stay! It’s bigger than it looks on the pictures! Clean beautiful and convenient I would highly recommend this place !

267293,7461611,2019-11-11,"Lisa's spot is just as described and shown in the photos and provided everything we needed! And, she was lovely to meet! Proximity to Prospect Park was very ideal. Everything else was a little bit of a hike but maybe that's just me, being a non-New Yorker, that I felt things were far away!"
840580,46601386,2020-12-16,"What a great host... Cathy was great from the beginning, accommodating my reservation in such short notice.  The place was stylish and spotless clean, and nicely decorated as well. The house was in a great location within walking distance from many services. Checkin and checkout was handled in a safe manner following Covid protocols, and I enjoyed the stay.  I would definitely come back and also recommend Cathy 's place to all my friends and colleagues."
431932,15561163,2019-03-28,Great value for money. <br/>The apartment was slightly larger than expected and very comfortable. Two of us stayed. One in the bedroom and the other on the air mattress which was really comfortable. <br/>Initially coming from Queensland in Australia there was a bit of a culture shock in the area but after that wore off we found the area to have great bars and restaurants and very easy to get around with local transport. <br/>The apartment was clean and comfortable. <br/>Michelle always responded very quickly to any questions we had. <br/>The ducted heating was a little inconsistent though we were provided with fans and extra heaters. But otherwise 5 stars!
479184,17778941,2019-05-25,"Check in was simple and straight-forward. Anna was very pleasant and polite. The room itself has great natural light and though small, is well organized to have everything you need + high ceilings to boot. Don't forget earplugs, as there is a school across the street that can get noisy during the morning. Also, parking was a breeze on the street, just be mindful of the rotating street sweeper days."
704079,32171100,2019-11-10,"Fue una experiencia inolvidable, nos trató como si fuéramos de su familia.  Nos ayudó en todo e hizo que nos sentimos como en casa. Todavía recordamos el último café con ella.<br/><br/>Elegiríamos el alojamiento de Josefina una y mil veces. Parte de nuestro corazón quedó allí. Esperamos verla pronto. <br/><br/>Sin lugar a dudas, recomendable 100%."
617798,25188064,2019-04-06,"This is my first time staying at an airbnb and it really exceeded my expectations! Karine was very nice and quick to respond from the moment I contacted her until the moment I left, it was always like talking to somebody who knew you for a long time! The apartment itself was very clean and cozy with stylish furniture and clean towels and linens, I already miss it!"
449232,16341416,2019-06-02,"So this place was really good! I would say there are some thing people should know before going there though. The place is next to not too great of an area so be a little more cautious coming back late at night if you’re not in a group of people. It is a very shared space, and there is a small child there and they’re the cutest little thing in the world. I didn’t mind either of these things at all, but other travelers may. The bed was very comfy and I feel like even though it was a shared space I had privacy. I would recommend staying here for a couple days!"
120626,1654929,2019-01-21,We enjoyed the cozy stylish basement and how thoughtful and accommodating the host is
120644,1654929,2019-07-03,Great place and neighborhood. The location is also great just a few blocks from the subway. We had a bit of a communication problem and misunderstandings with the check in but my sister and I had a great time.
136969,2017397,2019-05-12,"Place is exactly as advertised. Convenient location, cute decor, accommodates 3 adults comfortably. Easy to communicate with the host. Noise from upstairs was quite loud in the morning, but a trade off for a clean, nicely decorated, reasonably priced space in Brooklyn. A 10 minute walk to our friend's place. Would book again next time I visit. Thanks Monica and Sergio!"
458595,16730833,2019-05-19,Great place. Great stay. Will definitely be coming back.

780671,39139580,2021-03-10,Nice and cozy apartment. Very comfortable space to be living. The apartment is close to LES and East Village which is very convenient. Takeshi is definitely a super host. There were some loud noise from the neighbor upstairs but Takeshi did his best to alleviate the situation. I would recommend this apartment!
881184,51374868,2021-11-16,"Booked a last minute stay and Kento was quick to reply, very helpful and communicative. The decor is amazing, the bed is super comfortable and space is clean. Bathroom is a little small but very normal in NYC. Otherwise the place is very spacious, clean and pleasant to be in. I loved the meditation room. Gets amazing light during sunset."
635275,26741585,2019-08-15,"Although I use AirBnb a lot, this was my first time staying in a shared space. However, I never felt any discomfort or lack of privacy, thanks to the wonderful hosts Andrew and Adriana. <br/>The communication was very easy and fast, and despite my bus being late Andrew waited for me, and gave me a house tour. <br/>Every square inch of the house is sparkling clean, including shared kitchen and bathroom. All spaces are tastefully decorated. My room was spacious and cozy, with both Dyson fan and an AC, a bottle of complimentary sparkling water and a basket with toiletries in case the guest has forgotten something. <br/>I especially loved the travel brochure composed and designed by Andrew and Adriana themselves, based on their real experiences. It includes information on house rules, transportation, shopping, restaurants and cafes, things to do in Brooklyn and NYC bucket list, free activities, etc. <br/>The location is just great - with subway station just across the street and bus stop in front of the door, in a safe neighborhood, very close to Brooklyn's many attractions including wonderful Prospect Park and zoo, and adjacent Brooklyn Botanical Garden.<br/>I would definitely stay with Andrew and Adriana again, and would recommend their place to anyone."
618142,25224320,2021-08-09,"The apartment is nicely decorated, very stylish and clean. The room was very comfortable, the window and the view were my favorite part. <br/>Nate was very helpful and welcoming. <br/>The location is great to walk around Brooklyn, and also there is a subway station very near to go to Manhattan. <br/>There are many places to eat and buy food as well. <br/>I really enjoyed my stay here :)"

827408,45192589,2021-10-04,"This apartment was very clean and very spacious. All of the amenities were covered. The wifi worked well. It is very close to the subway system, and we were able to get to all of the things we wanted to see easily. The check-in process was different than usual, but worked smoothly. My daughter lives close by so this was perfect for us. If you are not used to big cities - we live in a suburb in a midwestern city - be prepared for the noise levels, even at night. We had ear plugs which made it very manageable."
868127,49881408,2021-09-06,"Nice area with a parking garage across the street (not included w stay, but it was in a convenient location.) <br/><br/>The check-in process was a bit of a hassle—the front desk person told me they could not find our reservation. After having to ask/run around, he told me that although my reservation was confirmed on Airbnb, it was never put into their system by the host. I messaged the host, and did not get a response until about an hour and a half after check-in. I feel like if you’re going to host you should at least be reachable at the time of check-in? Regardless, we were lucky that they actually had a room for us. <br/><br/>The room itself was clean but not in the best condition (paint chipping and peeling off of the bathroom door, AC did not have functional buttons to adjust settings). There was also a HUGE centipede that I had to kill. <br/><br/>They did have a bag check so we could check out and leave our bags, but it’s $2 per bag. Also had ice machines and vending machines available on some floors."
443082,16026567,2019-07-02,"I liked the cleanliness, the accommodations and the respect for privacy. A very good option in a good location in Brooklyn."

657709,28464743,2019-06-16,"A great spot to stay when visiting NYC! In the heart of Chinatown, you're a quick walk to the subway station and can get around the city very easily.  It's a quiet space, clean, and very cute! We loved calling this place home for our trip to New York!"
810198,42661402,2020-05-19,"Stay was great with Kat very welcoming and attentive when needed. Made some great grapefruit juice as well, very relaxing!"
808838,42540646,2020-06-29,Melissa's place was awsome and she was such a great host. The apartment looked just as it was pictured. Floor to ceiling widows makes for beautiful views of the city at night and a great place to watch the sun rise. The apartment was really in the center of Astoria close to many places to eat and you will be in the city in minutes if you drive or take public transportation. Definitely would stay again.
776505,38618500,2021-06-09,Great apartment with everything you need to enjoy your stay in Brooklyn New York. Very close to restaurants and shops as well as a short drive to Manhattan. Great hosts and excellent vacation

61629,568661,2021-02-21,"A cool building in a great location. Check in was easy via a lockbox. The place was quiet, clean, and very sunny and open. The bed was comfortable and there was an original Mean Streets movie poster on the wall which is always a good sign. The subway is close and there is  a lot to do in the neighborhood without walking very far. Also, parking is abundant and I found a spot to keep my car just steps from the front door."
888929,52470641,2021-09-29,"Kev place was perfect for one or two people. Everything was clean and we had enough privacy. Location is good, lot of delis around, train stations are close to the apartment too. Great deal for a last minute stay! Thank you!"
889522,52554389,2021-11-03,"Not for me. Efficiency hotels are great, but this place is dirty and not well kept."
810346,42661402,2021-10-24,"Hellen and Omar's place is really great. Not a bad walk from either the J/Z or the L/M trains. The room is nice and comfortable with a really tall ceiling. The common space is also a great vibe :)<br/><br/>Hellen and Omar are both super hospitable, they're incredibly engaging and caring. Very grateful for them allowing me to keep my luggage after checking out for the day! Would stay again for sure."

782898,39369799,2021-06-13,Jalena has a well appointed studio that is comfortable and super clean. Great bathroom and convenient location. This former Park Sloper had no difficulties parking in the nabe. Batch down the street and good islander food around the corner made it welcome place to host our weekend back in Brooklyn.
583099,22701969,2019-10-13,"Le logement était conforme à la description et à 5 min à pied du métro et de toute autre comodité (fast food, supermarché).

750163,35752161,2019-09-08,"Val’s apartment was really cute and clean. The location was perfect for us. The 125th subway station was only a few blocks away and got us to our destinations pretty quick. For this to be Harlem, the neighborhood was pretty quiet. There were some cultural activities going on that really gave us that true Harlem experience which was pretty exciting. Simple household amenities were missing such as washcloths, an iron and plunger. We had to purchase our own washcloths from a store down the street. The toilet was backed up and we had to ask the doorman if there was a plunger in the maintenance man’s supply room (luckily there was). The host asked us not to speak to anyone that worked or lived in the building but at that time it was our only option. I didn’t like the fact that it felt as though we weren’t really allowed to stay there.  That came off as sneaky and it made us feel extremely uncomfortable. The lock and key situation was a nuisance as well. The host sent us a tutorial explaining how to lock and unlock the door but it was still hard to get inside whenever we left. There was a pair of dirty panties on the balcony which was pretty gross. Also, part of the check out process was to remove the trash, wipe down counters and hang towels. I don’t understand why we needed to do all of that if we paid the $75 cleaning fee. Again the apartment was clean, location was great and Val was quick to respond  but overall this wasn’t my favorite Airbnb experience."

465140,17122439,2019-08-15,"Very clean space with everything a guest might need for a stay. Almost hotel-like feeling in terms of all the amenities, cleanliness and the fact it is exclusively used as a rental, but with thoughtful touches such as cute little patio (beware of mosquitos in the end of the summer though) and local tips provided by the hosts. <br/>Located in the heart of Harlem neighborhood with multitudes of things to explore. Among the highlights of our trip we ate fantastic Somali food in cafe Safari and saw an amateur night at the Apollo.<br/>Overall, very pleasant stay."
758341,36760354,2020-01-12,Myrtle was a great host and had great communication! I would definitely recommend.

594745,23597076,2021-11-30,"Great little place in mid-Bronx. Right near the zoo and botanical gardens. Very quiet and clean. Easy assess to 2 train and 15min to metro north. Parking spot is included which is really nice, but street parking is also available."
679518,30084665,2019-04-04,"If you decide to stay at Leah’s place, you definitely get what you pay for. The neighborhood is not one of the safest neighborhoods in BK, would not advise walking around that neighborhood especially in the evening or at night. The house is old and run down and looks like it’s under construction. The stairs felt abut unsafe. The room was big but very basic. The kitchen and common areas were not clean, with the exception of the bathroom, which was the cleanest. There was a lot of movement in the house even after midnight which made it hard to sleep peacefully, the movements subsided eventually. Also is a dog and a cat in the house which surprised me because there was no mention of any pets in the listing. Lastly, if you are checking in at night like I did, it can be a scary experience, for you have to enter the home through the back door. This area was dark and not well lit, I did not feel safe to be back there by myself. Thankfully, my friend accompanied me until I finally got inside the home. So if you are a single female traveler, you might want to check in to this place during day time hours.<br/>You definitely get what you pay for when staying in this place,  it’s budget friendly but it has its downside. I was there for only one night and just needed a clean room and bathroom, so this place served its purpose for me."
617395,25138975,2019-05-11,Great place <br/>Yaffa was great <br/>Great location
373442,13004996,2020-10-18,"Exactly as pictured, super clean, and great hospitality! Very bright space with all the necessary amenities. Gravel path and narrow, full-flight of stairs to enter. We used street parking and were able to park near the house every time. Beth was very welcoming and helpful! Our only things to note was that the loft space in a little shorter than it appears (my partner is 6ft, comfortable lying down but must crawl to edge), the bed was fairly hard, and the train and low flying planes were very noisy (if you aren’t used to it). Highly recommend this space if you want to stay in the area and we would love to stay again!"
395041,13841569,2019-07-31,"Great place close to everything Coney, great host with lots of local tips and a clean spot for a good price.  Would definitely come back."
481905,17975664,2020-12-15,Shiva’s place is the go-to for Airbnb in the Bronx. The place was very clean and spacious. I couldn’t find a complaint even if I tried. His place is only a few minutes walking distance from the 5 train which was very convenient. Shiva is a great host himself. Very chill and respectful dude. Had some great conversations with him and he’s always willing to point you in the right direction for local food spots. Would book again! Grab this spot while it’s available. You won’t be disappointed!
787281,39833359,2020-06-28,Great stay! Would recommend
465808,17142987,2021-04-10,"The place was very accurate in regards to description provided and photos. It was clean, which I appreciate and the location is pretty great. They provided a good amount of essentials as well as tried their best to answer quickly! The only downside is parking, which of course is not their fault. Before booking, a thing to keep in mind is that it is a STRUGGLE to find street parking and there aren't many parking garages nearby. The train is nearby, so it is beneficial if the person booking doesn't have a car. Overall, the experience was great and would book again!"
879207,51071173,2021-09-06,"Stay was great, the location was easy access to the train and clean. Great location if your coming into town for events or exploring the city."

He was very kind and responded very quick whenever I had questions and requests.<br/>I was going to stay only one month but I extended one month month since it was very comfortable staying his apartment.<br/>The room was huge, nicely decorated and very clean.<br/>I highly recommend his apartment if you are visiting to NYC!"
781280,39204077,2020-10-31,"This place was much better than I expected. Brigid always communicated in a timely manner and the hospitality was great. She even has welcome book with everything that you'll need regarding the house and local places to eat. The private entire is great and that shower is amazing, you go in that shower dirty and come out super clean with the serious shower head lol. Next time I visit New York I will book her place again."
528120,20242938,2021-11-19,"Clean, cozy, easy navigation as far as getting in and out of the place and having train stations close to the area. When I had any questions Lou was quick to respond. Felt like I had what I needed and overall enjoyed my stay."

815939,43375476,2020-10-20,"The place was very convenient in terms of location. Metro is only a 5-10 min walking distance and there are plenty of restaurants nearby as well as laundromat. The place itself is nice and cozy with a comfortable bed and sofa! The only thing I have to say is that it can get a little cold at night (I visited in mid September to October). Momoyo was very kind and welcoming. Overall, I would definitely recommend!"
884581,51827299,2021-11-15,"The place was really nice, cozy, clean and as expected based on the pictures. The hosts were also very responsive and accommodating if we had any questions. We enjoyed our stay and it was in a super accessible location."

801770,41585180,2021-08-08,"Great stay - A/C was much appreciated, kitchen was super functional, in-unit laundry was much appreciated. The place was also clean and bright. Great location too, and super easy check-in procedure + Eran was SUPER responsive throughout our stay. Fair warning that one of the bedrooms doesn't have windows, but wasn't an issue for us since we were mostly out of the apartment. Some quirks, but overall good experience!"
861103,49177819,2021-08-13,"I came to NY to focus on academic writing. I wanted a place where I could walk, have an outdoors space and a park for my dogs, great location. Stellar hosts and a great spot with great architecture."
773271,38281533,2021-05-22,I  would not have had anything wrong to say but there was a huge urine stain on the mattress pad and it was disgusting so when I reached out to the owner he flat out called me a liar and asked to come see it. We took pictures that are time stamped to our arrival. We did not request money back and worked around it but if you tell this guy something is not good he CANNOT hear it. We did not allow him up because we chose to only be there due to COVID safety precautions and privacy (hence why we went with an Airbnb and not a hotel). There is also a LARGE amount of water damage all over the apartment and if you step on the deck it’ll scare the pants off you because there’s air space between the concrete and whatever is stickered to it and it feels like your going to cave through.
536347,20688524,2020-11-25,"She was very accommodating.  There was a little difficulty on our end, but she made things work."
77248,773885,2021-04-10,"This apartment is so unique comparing all others in NYC, it's big and comfortable, with everything needed for live. We spent a month there and felt like home. I loved to spend time at the end of there day watching the movies on a big screen within projector and cool sound system. Really felt like in the cinema. Even though apartment is placed far from tourist attractions, the subway is close and in takes only 30-40 to most of them. You won't regret if stay here."
820598,44032999,2020-11-13,I had a great stay. Everything was as pictured.

324690,9895587,2020-02-12,"Nicely accessible. Was a bit afraid of the noise. But the room I was in was at the other side from the train tracks, and I never woke up (nor had trouble falling asleep) because of it."
778419,38836825,2019-12-03,The host canceled this reservation 27 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

537153,20710208,2021-09-14,"This tiny is just as advertised. The location is quite convenient and the space is comfortable and welcoming. <br/><br/>Stayed while visiting family in Brooklyn for 4 days/3 nights and this was just what we needed. <br/><br/>I recommend this space for anyone in need of a central, comfortable, albeit compact, space to call home for a short time when visiting the city."
780634,39139580,2020-08-16,Place was in the heart of the city! The decor and the house was beautiful!

36548,227715,2019-04-20,"While the location is good, my problem was multiple and as follows:<br/>1. We had made very clear that we would reach the place between 1130 pm to 01 am midnight. The host accepted and confirmed the booking and took the payment. Just a few hours before the check-in, the host sent a message through Air Bnb that she can't accommodate me at mid night and I will have to arrange for alternatives, this is at around 07pm and my checkin was supposed to be in 4 hours. So I had to book a different hotel online at an exhoberent rate in New york.<br/>2. Shocker 2. On arrival next morning, I understood that the host's employee lives there but wasn't ready to open the door at mid night. Though the care taker of the house was very friendly and helpful.<br/>3. Shocker 3. The listing said that it was an entire apartment available, but it's only a room with a shared bathroom.i found it very difficult since my money was already paid and I didn't have another place to go to with my 1.5 year old son and my wife.<br/>4. Shocker 4. The room was in the 3rd floor and no lift in the house. I literally had to do like 5 rounds up and down to get my luggage in the room.<br/>5. Dampner 5. There was no AC as the guy who was supposed to fix it didnt turn up. Though the weather in NY wasn't hot, but during the night, closed room gets very suffocating l. The cafe taker help3dnus with a table fan, but that's not what I had paid for."
269720,7572534,2019-12-04,"Ana was very welcoming and shared wonderful hospitality. Her apartment was perfectly located for my stay, close to Times Square and the theatre district.

Gracias Sr. Andy regresaremos a NY para seguir conociendolo, es una hermosa ciudad."
875129,50641438,2021-10-24,"Nice clean room in a great location, it's very easy to get around and into Manhattan from there. The host's wife that lives there is super friendly and helpful, there when you need anything but also doesn't bother you. They leave you water and fruit/snacks, WiFi is fast and water pressure is good. The room looks bigger in person as well. Overall good place to stay in if you're looking for a decent room to come back to"
752356,36102578,2019-10-03,Good place to explore NYC.<br/>Near to the J train that brings you directly to Manhattan.<br/>The appartement is clean and ok.<br/>Gabriel and Aquanna provided us with extra bottles of water and snacks. They respond very quickly to any questions

499077,18828846,2019-11-26,"The apartment itself isn’t bad for the price you pay. Very close to the ferry. The pictures are misleading as it is not an exclusive, big Staten Island apartment. It is a basement. There is free parking but it is on the street and if you can’t find a spot in front of the house you have to drive somewhere else to look. Not bad if you just plan to sleep there."

The apartment is well located and close to three subway stations (10 minute walk), so moving to any direction is fast and easy. He answered very fast to our questions. We even had a trouble with our taxi and he had no problem letting us to be at the apartment more time. Many thanks Kalana."
426185,15338155,2019-04-20,"Jose’s place was perfect! The room is super comfy and stylish, with a great tv right in front of the bed. The shower is great and the whole place is sparkling clean. There’s plenty of public transports just 5 min walk from the apartment. 30 min and you’re anywhere you want to go. We ended up coming late almost every night and transport was never a problem. Jose is super chilled and helpful, communication was great. We only rented the room and Jose was staying in the living room but privacy was not an issue at all. In summary, we couldn’t have asked for a better place to have some rest while visiting crazy New York, definitely recommend it."

The communication with the host was always fast. The apartment is spacious, stylish, private and very clean - felt like a brand new place! The bedroom and a bed itself are huge, and there is a walk-in closet with plenty of space as well as a large antique dresser. The living room area has a comfy leather sofa and a full well equipped kitchen, complete with a spice rack! Plus a large TV with Netflix. A comfortable, well designed and convenient space.

El barrio es muy tranquilo, y tiene una oferta culinaria muy extensa en la calle Steinway. La habitación no es muy grande, pero es muy cómoda, tiene una heladera pequeña dentro. Rosa es muy buena, ordenada y limpia. Muchas veces preparó mi café por la mañana o incluso cocinaba para los dos. Ella trabaja, y es una persona socialmente activa, por lo que muchas veces no está en la casa. La comunicación es muy fácil y siempre que pudo ayudarme, lo hizo.<br/>Sin dudas volvería a su casa"
819890,43899350,2021-05-02,"I really enjoyed my stay at Kyle and gave it 4 stars. <br/>The location was BEYOND amazing. so close to everything and there was a deli right downstairs! <br/>The room is small but they use the space well so there is room for storage and your things. <br/><br/>I took one star off because I don't think it' s mentioned in the listing but the room is over a bar Taboo with a backyard area that can become very noisy. The bar shut down the backyard at 11pm on weekdays 12 midnight on weekends. <br/>I don't know if that is set in stone or a response to de Blasio's pandemic guidelines but the fact is you can easily hear voices scream-singing  ""happy birthday"" even 6 floors up. <br/><br/>If you are deeply sensive to noise you might want to consider bringing ear plugs or a white noise machine."
373895,13027365,2019-06-24,"Eine originelle Wohnung im Vintage-Stil. Die Wohnung ist sauber und gepflegt und in einer ruhigen Gegend gelegen. Die Küche ist gut ausgestattet (wir haben jedoch nicht gekocht, deshalb kann ich nicht sagen, ob genug Kochgeschirr vorhanden ist). Die Betten waren bequem (sind ca. 150 x 200 cm groß). Das Haus und die Wohnung sind jedoch alt, was bedeutet es ist etwas muffig und die Sanitäranlagen sind etwas veraltet: Der Wasserdruck in der Dusche war zu gering, so das wir es schwierig fanden zu duschen. Dusche und Toilette sind nicht getrennt.<br/>Von der Wohnung bis zu den Touristenzielen in Manhattan (z.B.

There were lack of fresh air circulation in our room even if the weather was not so hot. One important point from my point of view, if you do not prefer the closest subway station which is G - Myrtle Willioughby, the other areas wasn’t look so secure to walk in the night. We didn’t have any issue during our stay but it is good to take into consideration this. Thanks for all your help and communication during our stay. We appreciate your all support."

677829,29984607,2019-03-24,"Best location at a great price!! Clean, quick responses, all you need for a budget vacation at NYC.

801815,41591285,2021-10-24,"Free on site parking just means street parking, which was usually available within a couple of blocks. Wrong keys were in the drop box. Host sent additional keys via an Uber driver but they also didn’t work. She did offer me an additional unit in the building but then showed up with the correct keys.<br/>Bathroom photos did not match the unit. Space was efficient for my needs as I worked 12 hour days and really just needed a place to sleep and shower. Plastic wrap still on mattress did make for some noisy tossing and turning. Price per night was the lowest I was able to find in the area."

We really got lucky with parking and did not spend any $$ on parking. The speed of the internet made working from his place was seamless. Given that there are no elevators, it is definitely a good work out to get to the 3rd floor, so pack light. Overall a great place and good value for money."

765466,37366396,2021-07-06,"Detailed review: <br/>First I want to say the room is ok and Maria is nice. The location is great, is just 300 meters away from the metro station, line purple that gets you direct to Manhattan after 30 minutes. But wait, yes 30 minutes, think about it deeply because if you are a tourist and you are looking for this place because is cheaper than staying in Manhattan, let me tell you that those 30 minutes are forever after a long day of being a tourist at NY (you have to think twice if you want to go to leave some shopping or groceries or just go resting a little while during the day because it will take more than 1 hour to go and come back to the apartment). So as a person I have been twice as a tourist in NY I can say is worth spending $20 more per night to stay in Manhattan to have the apartment nearby, trust me. I'm young enough to walk a lot and I regret not staying in Manhattan to have a close apartment ($20 a day is one lunch, one thing shopped, anything. Spend it staying close).<br/><br/>But if you still decide to stay here, let me tell you the room is almost as it is shown in the pictures (the only difference is that now it has some red decorations that are pretty ugly). The bad thing is that the small bed was dirty. I think it is assumed the 2 people allowed for the room are going to sleep in the big bed but if you don't plan this, take into account the small bed is probably dirty as they don't change the blanket (sheets). When I asked Maria for a clean blanket she did not answer.<br/><br/>The rest of the room was clean, the bathroom was clean, the kitchen clean, the sink does not work pretty well. AC does not work, I can't imagine sleeping there in summer, is pretty hot.<br/><br/>Please, think it again: STAY CLOSE TO MANHATTAN, even though is not cheap, is really exhausting being a tourist in NY and you want to come back to sleep quickly to take advantage of the next day."
774853,38469091,2020-01-11,"After a terrible day of travel, it was so comforting to check-in at Wycliffe’s place. He made check-in easy for (Email hidden by Airbnb) munication was fast and easy. The place is extremely comfortable and is outstanding value when compared to hotels in the area. The apartment has many added touches that go the extra mile. Great shower, great towels, comfy bed and lounge. Highly recommend Wycliffe’s place to anyone wanting to stay near JFK. our biggest disappoint is that we didn’t get to spend more time here!"

The neighborhood is a nice, local gem with plentiful options for food and markets and was very economical. Close to the 7 line, it’s just a quick 15 min ride into Manhattan. Joseph was a very good host with timely responses and was extra accommodating in facilitating the check in process. I would very much recommend to stay at Joseph’s place."

Clean, cute space... conveniently located to multiple train lines.<br/>Only downside was walls are super thin (can hear everyone staying there) and water line for other units connects through the unit, so you can hear others showering, etc.  This, however, was not a huge issue for me."

766671,37549695,2021-09-09,"IF YOU WANT TO SLEEP LATE, DO NOT STAY HERE. All we wanted was a quiet place to relax and recharge while going through some personal turmoil, and that proved IMPOSSIBLE. The owner has two small children, and very thin floors. The children were up and STOMPING around at 7AM! Also, the bed is a Full size, not a queen, so it isn't the most comfortable for a couple to share. The bathroom is very poorly designed, with the toilet jammed in a corner, so that I wasn't able to sit straight, but at an angle, a very strange open-concept shower, and possibly the smallest sink I've ever seen. The TV also does not swivel and is hard to see from the bed. All of this, with a $70 (!!!) cleaning fee on top. Honestly, the location is really the only thing that is worth considering. Nice area of Brooklyn, although extremely gentrified, and VERY expensive."

I felt as though I was at home and living with a dear friend. He gave me a lot of amazing recommendations and the location is pretty great with a very short walk to a metro station which will take you to all the main attractions in NYC. Next time I come back to New York I’ll definitely be staying with Arya again!

We ubered to and from JFk mostly because I didn't feel like taking my heavy suitcase up and down the stairs for the subway.  LOL  However, it would be completely doable if you were on a budget.  The place had so much New York charm.  It definitely added a special feel to our trip.  Check in and out was super easy.  Would definitely recommend."

He recommended FUMO, a restaurant where I had the best meal of my life. This was our first Airbnb experience and thanks to Xavier it was a successful one.

It‘s just as on the pictures and we felt really at home after a busy day in Manhattan. Check-In was also super easy.<br/>The neighbourhood is quiet and the location perfect. You have everything near by, such as restaurants, grocery shopping and ATMs. It takes only a 15 minutes ride to Manhattan by subway. After a 5 minutes walk you will reach the water. From there you can just enjoy the beautyful view of the Skyline (very nice in the evening as well).<br/>Ella is a very nice host, helpful and very fast in responding!

537139,20710208,2020-08-23,"I am giving this such a review because the cleanliness was just horrible. This was my first stay at an air bnb during COVID and when I read they had a cleaning crew professionally come and clean (and had a cleaning fee) I was excited to not have to worry about that. But upon arriving I was filled with anxiety about the place being clean.<br/>I messaged about my issue on cleanliness the morning after the first night. And it took hours (5 hours for them to reply) for them to respond (they had responded before in a very timely manner-within the hour). And it was just saying they have a professional crew come. Nothing else or tried to help with a solution (they did give us new sheets and towels which were a little better-but no offer to refund the cleaning fee at the least). I provided pictures and descriptions of everything that what was not clean:<br/><br/>1) the sheets look absolutely disgusting. Stains all over them. They were able to give us new sheets which had less stains on them but still had some stains.<br/>2) there was hair (maybe pubes) on be ground in the bathroom near the shower and on the shower ground. Really really gross.<br/>3) there was toothpaste spit in the sink that we had to clean (there was also no soap at all there - which during COVID I would expect there to be: we got some and a sponge and left it there so people could clean their dishes and hands). <br/>4) there is a very scratchy and uncomfortable wool blanket on the bed. I highly doubt it is being washed and dried between stays, given the check out time is 12pm and the check is at 3pm, the cleaning time is 3 hours and it definitely takes longer than that to clean wool.<br/>5) it smelled very strongly of mildew and mold when we got there <br/>6) the towels smelled very very badly, like mold (we got new ones with our sheets that they gave us but still not ideal to shower with smelly towels).<br/><br/>I would not recommend this place for anyone at risk or worried about COVID. <br/><br/>The price is definitely not worth the stay. If there’s a $100 cleaning fee I expected way better and to feel way safer (COVID).  I read other reviews before this and they all looked very promising, with a few mentions about the sheets and cleanliness. Maybe the lack of cleanliness didn’t matter as much pre COVID but it certainly should be the top priority now."

120669,1654929,2020-11-22,"Could’ve DEFINITELY been cleaner. Condiments in refrigerator and other refreshments in kitchen were expired/days from expiring. No wash cloths or hand towels. Also very noisy when someone is close to the plank that separates the downstairs from the upstairs, I guess. Heard conversations very clearly. Also the unit was not as pictured. Does not have a couch but instead a very uncomfortable metal chair. APARTMENT WAS WAY TOO HOT! I wrote the host about it and she said it was central heat throughout the house but it was entirely too hot my whole stay. Overall, definitely could’ve been cleaner."

870501,50069160,2021-08-29,"Great location and a great experience.  I was in the area for a 60th birthday party.  My wife found this boat on AirBnB, it was very close to the location of the party, the Belle Harbor Yacht club.  I arrived and quickly gained access to the parking lot, along with the key to the boat.  Location has a good size parking lot that is gated in, requires a key fob for entry.  Settled in and opened a beer to enjoy the atmosphere. It was drizzling a little but sat out on the on the rear of the boat to enjoy the experience.  I only stayed the one night, the bed was comfortable and I slept well.    I played some music and had an overall great experience and if I need to be in the area again, I would book this location again.<br/>Tip:  Car needs to very close to the yellow line at the gate for the fob to function upon exit.<br/>Emily shared quite a bit of local information that was handy to have and she was very responsive to any communication we had."
587675,23090887,2019-10-26,L'appartamento di Dan è perfetto per gruppi di 6-7 persone. La cucina è ben equipaggiata e permette di preparare colazioni e cene per tutti senza problemi.

455145,16546903,2019-04-07,"OMGosh.... There are not enough nice words that sum up our experience at Miss Jackie’s. This was our first time ever meeting her and I am getting welled up near tears writing this review. I had read past reviews and was already looking forward to a great experience and everything written is true (clean home, check-in flexibility, friendly animals, morning pastries). Every single positive thing said about Miss Jackie as a host is completely accurate, however the personal touch that tipped the scale for me was her attending and showing support at my boyfriends comic book festival event !! That was AMAZING!!! She didn’t have to do that but SHE DID and it was greatly appreciated !! We cannot thank her ENOUGH for everything!! I’m sure there are plenty of places to stay in NY, but it doesn’t even matter because Miss Jackie’s is where we are staying. Hands down, no question."

Very residential and quiet, while being close to Central Park, nearby restaurants and subway lines. I love this part of NYC. The apartment itself was great - exactly as shown, with comfortable bed, good equipped kitchen, fast WiFi and great cable TV (with NY1 news station, which is the best local news anywhere). Coffee, sugar, bottled water, snacks and even a bottle of wine provided for our convenience, which was so appreciated. A request for early check was accepted which was much appreciated.

663366,28910248,2021-10-12,"The space was good and pretty clean. However, the AirBnB posting makes it seem like there is a private hallway to get to the space. To access the space, one must pass through the hosts kitchen and living area (we were not fond of that). Also, I’m not sure if it is the nature of the city or the apartment itself, but the outside was very loud! A bit hard to sleep at times. But, it is a good location for the train and in the middle between JFK airport and Manhattan."
139161,2089226,2021-06-27,The room is adequate and AC makes it work in the summer.  The overall apartment could be cleaner and more organized.  And the hall lights were always off but had little motion censored light when you walked by.   This was not very welcoming.  But my room door did have a lock.  CS was super hospitable.

Thankfully Albert responded really quickly and we had a room for the night (for a fee). The apartment is located about 5-8mins walk away from several subway stations. The room was spacious, was pleasantly decorated and the bed was comfortable. The floor had 2 bathrooms which was great, easy access to kitchen. Albert also allowed us to leave our heavy luggages in the apartment after checking out, which was really nice of him. Overall, great stay experience! Only thing to note is that the room is located on the 3rd floor, but it wasn’t an issue for us at all (:"

And due to the extrem hot period, whole week with outer temperatur > 90 oF, the air conditioning equipament was not enough to cool it."

475309,17652158,2021-10-27,"After my travel partner and I arrived at Russell's place. we had to wait 10 minutes at the front door waiting for him to send us instructions on how to get in. It was disappointing to find our room dusty, smelly, filthy with a sofa covered with animal fur, and a bed with human hair in the sheets. The sheets were unwashed, with many oily spots, black marks, and hair stacked in the sheets and pillow covers. We couldn't believe how nasty the room was, especially when the world is still recovering from a pandemia and cleaning standards are essential. His place clearly didn't follow Airbnb's 5-step cleaning process, which I checked in the Airbnb app before booking that place. In addition to all the mentioned, his room was not the same as advertised in the airbnb pics. While we were looking for solutions to stay safe and comfortable, Russell and I were exchanging phone texts. He was apologetic at first, offering a candle, stiffer and clean sheets, but then he got defensive and cancelled our booking. We had to leave his room late at night and under the rain to find another safer and sanitized place to stay. We finally found another Airbnb place in better conditions. I have been around the world with Airbnb and never had an issue like this before."

Overall we would highly recommend this apartment!

He greeted us even though we were delayed due 2 flight… He explained the operation of all that we needed 2 be comfortable and safe… His decor and cleanliness of his home was the BEST I’ve ever experienced in mi Airbnb history! I felt more at home than any hotel! To show my appreciation for his welcoming and good hearted nature & this wonderful stay, I replaced the items he placed in his home for our use… it was cool by the AC in the bedrooms on the hottest of days & the beds were soooooo comfortable I got the best rest!!! His home is a few steps from city transportation and I was very blessed to have stayed in this beautiful home! Please do yourself and anyone that you are bringing to NYC with you a loving favor by choosing MR JOSEPH’s HOME AWAY FROM HOME!

The closest subway station is a 10-15 minute walk. The host welcomed us with a basket of goodies, provided a Keurig with pods, and some milk in the fridge. Noise does travel a bit from the 2nd floor. If you are a light sleeper, bring earplugs or pull up white noise on your phone. A good value and we would stay here again."

The person who came to clean the checked out rooms did not clean bathroom so bath mat was soaking wet for more then one day, and when changed was put in kitchen window to dry so kitchen smelled like wet dog. Our pillow cases and blanket smelled like BO and we had to request all new bedding. Would not recommend for a long stay."

877307,50900377,2021-08-07,"I can't say anything good about the place, the only good thing that the host was flexible with the check in and brought the keys straight to us. <br/>The place was dirty and smelly. Kitchen and the shared living room looked like nobody ever cleaned it. Room super dirty too, we checked in a day later, so host had an extra day to clean it. when we brought up this problem, host's explanation was, ""room is dirty because previous guests left it dirty"" (??). <br/>Also the train line is just in front of the window. yes, maybe the windows are sound proof, but you would never know that because it should be open due to A/C installation. So you wont get any sleep because of trains noise.<br/>Also the guests from another room had friends over almost every night and were super loud all night  with music on, so you also can't get sleep because of that. Another problem with guests in the  apartment was weed smoking. The whole place smelled like weed all day all night. The girl just casually came to light up her weed joint from the stove just in front of me when I was cooking. And about this problem host reply was like ""I didn't smell any weed there"". <br/>On the top of everything, there was room #3 in the apt sealed by NYPD due to unclear death of the tenant who used to live there. As we found out it happed like a month ago, and the body was dicovered about a week later. Room wasn't desinfected yet and you could feel the smell when being next to it. And host didn't even bother to let us know about this fact, otherwise we would have never booked a room in this apt in the first place. <br/><br/>We spent there few nights, as long as it took Airbnb Support to process cancelation and help us find new place. <br/><br/>Absolutely do not recommend this place."
420699,15052455,2019-09-13,"Kimberly’s place is about twice as large as you will get at any NYC city hotel. Very clean and walking distance to nice bars, restaurants and cafes.

Had I notified Elizabeth earlier during the day, I’m pretty sure it’d be replaced that very same day. She was also so kind and generous to refund the room charge for that day!<br/><br/>The room is nice and clean and has all the essentials for a few nights stay. The neighborhood is quiet but there are small shops nearby and the metro station is just minutes away.  I was up on the third floor, and the water pressure in the shower was a bit low, but it was not a major problem. This is a great Airbnb experience and I’d stay there again!"

Even the bed, is really very good. There’s some supermarkets near, grocery stores, and is in a very live neighborhood at night, a real good place to stay, with near subway and buses stations. If you are reading this to see feedbacks before booking, this is the place. Is a very good place, with very nice people. And one day, I hope I will be back. Thanks for everything Irie, Jeremiah and Marcus!"

29089,159749,2019-07-01,Host were very kind and responsive. We felt safe in room and neighborhood. Room was large and private. The room had some cleanliness issues especially in the bathroom. It could use a deep clean and then cleaning in between guests. House itself is historic with lots of great details but is older. Mattresses need to be replaced. We got plenty of clean towels. Check in and check out easy and the room was quiet.
826863,45117459,2021-04-11,"Cozy little spot by right next to the beach. Loved the nostalgic vhs collection & shower dual mirrors and heated floors.<br/><br/>Favorite thing about my stay would be waking up with all the plants & fresh flowers and natural sunlight. <br/><br/>I was intouch with Joel, he was nice and responsive! Leslie sent all the info. <br/><br/>Great place to stay, thanks"

705810,32355657,2021-06-13,We had such a great experience in Lorena's apartment. She was a great host and check-in/out was a breeze. The location is fantastic; in Chelsea and easy walking distance to East/West/Greenwich Villages. Very close to the waterfront for much needed exercise to offset meals from all of the fantastic restaurants in the area. It was so nice having two ensuite bedrooms and not have to use a sofa bed for our family of four. The kitchen is as fully equipped as possible. Can't say enough about the view! Thanks for a great stay!
711689,32819286,2020-01-05,"I had a very pleasant stay. Cookie and Ron came out to greet us. Very nice clean quiet place. Access to full kitchen bathroom . Wonderful cozy room located close to stores, public transportation."
567695,21966432,2019-05-20,"Luis’ apartment was small but very clean.  Bed was huge and very comfortable.  Wouldn’t recommend for more than 2 people that know each other intimately or a couple with a small child.  Neighborhood was safe and parking was easy to secure.  Curb appeal could be improved as exterior didn’t match the neighborhood or the trendy interior.  Wifi didn’t not work our entire stay and had to reset cable box three times to watch tv, but otherwise clean, cozy, and quiet accommodations. We didn’t use the kitchen but appreciated having one that was fully stocked.  With the exception of a café and pizza shop most retail and restaurants are located a good 20 minute walk away on Prospect West.  Two small parks with very nice playgrounds were within a 2 block radius – good for someone traveling with young kids. Recommend for anyone traveling with their vehicle looking for simple, safe, and well appointed accommodations at a fair price"

548545,21204890,2020-07-04,"Nice close to the metro and with a nice park in front of it. Great hospitality, Sergio was very accommodating. The room does get a bit hot since there’s no window unit or central ac, but I also came in the summer time."

212362,4760107,2019-09-22,"This is a really nice place for a short term stay. My wife and I just stayed here for a month and we were very comfortable the entire time. We were originally shopping for short term stays in Manhattan but the prices can be quite expensive if you’re not prepared. This place offered us what we needed: a comfortable place with easy access to the city (20 min subway to Financial District), and a nice neighborhood. If you’re unfamiliar with Brooklyn you might be a little apprehensive about staying in the neighborhood but you really shouldn’t be. Boerum Hill is very nice and it’s also close to Brooklyn Heights which is even nicer. The neighborhood is a lot of families and young people, some very wealthy because the full brownstone apartment buildings sell for several million. There are several bars/restaurants within a block of two that would be right at home in the West Village.  Also many more bars and restaurant s if you wander even farther. A nice 1 mile walk (depending on the season) to the Brooklyn Bridge Park and piers with amazing views of the city. It’s also around the corner from a Brooklyn Fare grocery store that is much larger than it appears from the outside. During the night the block is quiet and safe. We slept soundly throughout our trip. Benjamin, our host, was very responsive to our messages and any needs we had during our stay. If you’re looking for something affordable that is a good space in a nice neighborhood with easy access to Manhattan then this place is worth jumping on."

318967,9707671,2019-08-03,"Will is a generous host. I stayed long-term (one month) for business reasons, and when he was away for a few days in between, he would allow me to use the entire apartment as if it was my own. Even when he was around, he always respected my privacy. I visited in summer, and the A/C worked great. No issues with Wi-Fi either. The location is great because it's just a few minutes' walk to the subway station. Apartment is on the 4th floor walk-up, but that's not uncommon in NYC apartments in case you're new to the area. There are washers/dryers in the basement of the building, but I relied on the laundry service next door instead for convenience. If I were to mention a couple small complaints: 1) the bed is not very comfortable, and the bed frame is somewhat unstable. 2) I also wish there was a small table of sorts in the bedroom because I preferred to work in the bedroom as there is no A/C in the living room. Aside from these, I was satisfied with my stay, and would recommend Will's place if you're visiting the area."

I was interested in her place because of the bathroom but after seeing photos I was so inspired to utilize it for more content (pics). <br/>Yelle’s place is clean, accommodating & so artistic.

431960,15561163,2020-11-08,"I spent a week there before I was able to head back to Europe,  Michelle was very accommodating with my change in plans  and very responsive via airbnb messaging. <br/>Some overall things to be aware of when staying here<br/>- flat is upstairs, so you if you have heavy bags or are not physically fit this will be difficult as you have to get up a flight of stairs outside and steep stairs inside<br/>- its nice and quiet, the bedroom is towards the back and was very quiet at night which is nice. Except for weekend nights where neighbours liked to play music until midnight (given the brownstone gardens it echoes quite intensely)<br/>- Bed is very comfortable! <br/>- no toaster available and kitchen is limited stocked with equipment <br/>- I was working whilst there which was hard as there is only a very small table and  folding chairs which arent made to sit on for hours. wifi is ok, had some issues but again, I was working, perfectly fine wifi for recreational purposes. <br/>- the floor boards are very squeaky and it's hard to know how much is heard downstairs (even when walking softly, it's just the way the floor is), so the house rules of quiet time after a certain time is hard to follow as every step squeaks, but if you go to bed by 10pm you are fine. <br/>- neighbourhood is classic Bed-Stuy and tourist should do their research and be smart, but it seemed safe/fine"
857266,48720509,2021-09-11,The room was very cozy and clean and Lupe made sure we were comfortable. Would definitely recommend.

46403,318021,2019-06-19,"I had the pleasure of staying 6 weeks at Michael's apartment. He's a great host who welcomes you to his home and let you feel at home right away. The apartment is exactly what it looks like on the pictures and was always super clean. You get to Midtown in less than 30 minutes from his place in Harlem with the subway and it just takes you a 5 minute walk to get to the north of Central Park. It's just the perfect base to discover the city. <br/>Michael's always there to give you advice how to get through the NYC jungle and up for some funny chitchat. <br/>If you have the chance to stay at Michael's place, do so, you won't regret it!"

There is an express coach bus  twice a day which didn't fit my schedule. <br/><br/>My room was very comfortable and just as pictured on the website, I appreciated having a work desk, mini-fridge and coffee pot of my own.   <br/><br/>The shared bath was very clean.  <br/><br/>Hyonok offered egg, croissant and fruit for breakfast.  <br/><br/>The host is a  yoga teacher  I will be back and take a class from her."

The living room is a cool, kitsch space, though there's definitely a lot of street and subway noise. Thankfully the bedroom is quieter so we didn't have any trouble sleeping. The bedroom is a little featureless (no decor, nightstand or lamp) but the bed is very comfortable."

855312,48470766,2021-10-04,Guests be aware. This neighborhood is not safe. fights and some drugs action going on around this place. The building is very old and dirty. The flooring was not stable and feels like it is falling when you walk on it. This is not the experience you want to have.
100237,1089542,2019-11-17,"Looking for a great deal super close to the subway? This is it. Karen and her family are friendly and welcoming. They were happy to work around my late night comings and goings, and offered me everything I needed for my stay. I felt safe walking from the subway to their apartment, and the room itself was clean and warm. There was a huge mirror in the room, closet, mini fridge and fan. I was primarily looking for a place to sleep while in the city all day, and this was perfect for a woman traveling alone."

The room was very nice. <br/>The only thing is that it was listed as had 2 beds, only 1 was pictured so I asked if it has 2, I was told yes it's just not pictured, and when we got there, there was 1 bed, and a mattress folded in the closet. She was very helpful to give us sheets for the mattress, but on my end I thought it was obvious we needed two beds so there was just some miscommunication there. BUT  would still highly recommend!"

693693,31178012,2019-04-07,"The room was nice. The location is very far. Thankfully I drove my car but I wanted to leave it and take the subway. I would have been upset as the home is on the other side of Queens, very close to the border of Long Island which is less than a 10 minute drive. There is no mention of a dog anywhere in the listing. I didn't know there was a dog until I arrived. It was too late to cancel so I had to deal with itchy and watery eyes all weekend. I received a text on Friday from the host saying she left the key in the mailbox but when I arrived, no key. The host came home to let me in and said she told the last guest to leave the key but they didn't. I feel as the host that should have been her responsibility to make sure this was done. I am just glad I drove as it was cold and rainy on Friday. The bathroom was not the cleanest but there was another guest in the home so I suspect it was them. The room was nice but it was really cold Friday night. There is a heater but it didn't put out any heat. It wasn't a bad stay, just needed some improvements. I don't think I would stay again though. The host is a nice lady though."

Our hosts were friendly and helpful and even allowed us to leave our bags for a couple of hours after we checked out, which we really appreciated. Overall, the apartment is great value for money and we would absolutely stay again when we are next in NYC."

The neighborhood is beautiful and the train/ bus station is 8 min away. The communication with David was awesome. He responded right away. Foodstores and restaurants are in the neighborhood.

It’s a great value for New York and there is a bunch to do right around the Airbnb for the days you don’t want to venture too far. It’s also super close to the subway. Will definitely stay here again. <br/><br/>One thing to note is that during the pandemic, Ez isn’t providing the basic cooking supplies (oil, salt, pepper, etc.). This wasn’t a deal breakers, but wanted to note it in case anyone reading this review is expecting that. <br/><br/>Overall, a great stay, and I’ll definitely stay here again in the future"

Subways, shopping, restaurants, and the park are all nearby plus the vibe of Brooklyn is nicely subdued compared to the bustle of Manhattan. Bridgette is super nice and was very responsive to my inquiries making it easy to check in and out. We really enjoyed our stay and recommend it if you want/need space and privacy during your trip to NYC."

636781,26842735,2021-03-20,"The Bad<br/>- Not the ideal set up for long term stays: does not have available closet space, dresser space, or any room to store toiletries in the bathroom (all storage packed to capacity with hosts toiletries)<br/>- There was a dirty razor in the bathroom, uncleaned silverware, and coffee-coated mugs<br/>- Bidet not working and is disconnected<br/>- Does not have cable TV like listing says<br/>- Sinks and shower both have draining issues <br/>- Very lived in — compared to other long term stay units that I have booked    before<br/><br/>Not bad<br/>- Nice location <br/>- In lieu of providing much space to store things, the host provides a decent free-standing, exposed clothing rack, which I was able to hang shirts and jackets on.  There was a shoe rack which I was able to store folded clothes on.  My suitcase was able to go in the corner <br/>- The listing said there was a washer and dryer which was a reason i booked it — There’s a washer and dryer in the basement which the host kindly let me use their laundry card for"

Less than 10 min from the front door of the apt to the front desk on my unit. <br/>Excellent apt with 1 small issue- roaches. Vibe Apts responded to every email timely. And did spray the apt regularly. But there was no getting rid of the roaches. They werent too too bad. But they are there. <br/>I would stay here again if I come back to Bellevue Hospital.

776903,38666081,2019-11-28,"Felt like home... My stay at Isaac's started out with a minor issue which was not his fault and he was very responsive! My one ""complaint"" is that it was noisy at times (loud neighbor dog, loud yelling on neighboring balcony, bed located right next to hall) but this wasn't always the case; it was definitely quiet at times too. I liked the location, in an area with soul close to trains and 2 great coffee shops in either direction right around the corner. The washer+dryer in the apartment was a major plus. The couch is super comfy, as is the bed. Super simple check in. Overall, it's a real genuine place that I would stay at again. Thanks again Isaac!"

It is very clean an orderly and well-organized.<br/>It has lovely furnishings including both a shower and tub and the bathroom. The bathroom and kitchen especially are very up-to-date. One of the nicer features is that unlike many Airbnb properties the sofa in the living room is a real sofa and not a futon so it is very comfortable for sitting and reading or watching television. We would definitely stay here another time and highly recommend it."
504096,19069305,2020-02-02,The place is exactly as advertised. Yuval responds to questions quickly and helps you with everything. It's really easy to get from his place to Manhattan and there is also a lot of things to do around the area. I can definitely recommend Yuvals place.
705564,32317602,2020-01-26,"This was our (my best friend and I) first time in NYC. We were a little nervous about not knowing nah of the areas and feeling safe but this AirBNB was amazing! It was right by a bunch of really fun bars, the little shop right next door was super cute. It is 3 stories up and the stair case was a little steep, so keep that in mind while packing! We packed all of our stuff in a backpack, which was ideal in this situation. We didn’t use any of the amenities in the house (kitchen,  TV, etc) but everything was very clean and tidy. The bathroom is small but just what we needed. Being from Florida, neither of us have ever used/seen a radiator, which is what keeps the place warm. One night we got back and it was making a strange noise (to us) and I texted the owner and he was quick to respond and said that was normal as it adjusts to the temperature (for those of you who don’t have experiences with radiators). It was also super close to Time Square. We would absolutely stay here again! As two women in a big city, we felt very safe here, which was super important to us!"

I moved into this room after living in quite a noisy area in Brooklyn and I cannot recommend her space highly enough to ANYONE working or traveling in New York City. Gen was more like a mom to me, she was always kind, offered me the most delicious coffee in the morning, always kept the apartment sparkling clean, asked about my day and made sure all the guests always felt comfortable. <br/>The room is very spacious and I completely fell in love with the neighborhood, which is super save, very friendly and convenient as all kinds of stores, a laundromat, the supermarket and the 1 train station, which takes you right into downtown Manhattan in no time, are in walking distance. <br/>Gen's place is not just an Airbnb, it's a home and especially if you're a working professional seaking a quite and cozy room to look forward to when you come home, this gem of a space is what you've been looking for :)"

890598,52795626,2021-11-12,"The place was new when I stayed there. Unit was exactly as pictured, great space! Gym was awesome and I enjoyed the location. My dislike is how disorganized they were. I think this place will be fantastic once they have been operating for a touch longer, but there were a couple of issues at the beginning of my trip, so I don’t believe the cost aligned with the experience I was given. Probably just bad luck being one of their early customers!"

All the amenities, starting with the washer and dryer, were perfect. This definitely made us feel like home. This place was better than some of the top of the line hotels we have stayed in. It is the best Airbnb  we have stayed in so far when coming to New York, and we will try to book it every time we come.  Dexton and Carline"
499089,18828846,2020-05-24,It was wonderful to be hosted by Kat! I love visiting NY and her place is truly a home away from home! Would absolutely stay here again!

786832,39752892,2021-05-09,"We had a great stay at Curtis's apartment.  It was a perfect location and very comfortable - we especially enjoyed the outdoor balcony!  Curtis was quick to respond to a question about the lock box, and the apartment was clean and comfortable.  The only thing I would mention is that there is a slight smell of smoke, but we opened the windows and it did not impact our enjoyment of the weekend, just something to note if you are sensitive to the smell.  I would definitely stay here again."
761085,37019982,2019-12-17,"Katherine’s place was amazing and everything as pictured. Great location, not to far from the city just a quick train ride away.

It is in a great location (walk to Lexington, Maddison, Park and 5th Avenue, Central Park, MET, Guggenheim, Whole Food Supermarket and easy to get further afield via public transport - i.e. Columbia University, downtown). Sparkling clean. Very comfortable beds.  Safe and accessible building/apartment for children."

792311,40430816,2020-02-16,"This place has a lot of potential. The room is spacious, I liked the wood flooring and the private entrance is a plus. The room is undergoing a renovation and thus there is no private bathroom. Unfortunately I didn’t know this before booking and was really let down because I didn’t want/need to share a bathroom. That being said you’ll be sharing the bathroom with two other long term tenants. The lock on the bathroom door didn’t work you’ll have to use a latch. Also the middle knob in the shower Is loose you’ll have to really maneuver. As far as the other ‘roommates’ We stayed out of each other’s way. Do take note that one of them is up at 4am during the week and is a bit noisy. The walls were a bit thin so I didn’t get the best sleep. The host is nice and responsive and I felt comfortable addressing my concerns. She  provides you with water, towels, toilet paper etc which I enjoyed. I think that once this place is completely fixed, (the bathroom, blinds, door latches etc.) it will be great."
642366,27371581,2020-06-23,"Jessica's place carried such a nice clean,  beachy vibe and was perfect all around! Conveniently close to the beach, bars, restaurants and so much more.

329619,10120206,2019-03-24,"Definitely not the cushiest place the stay, but a really cool experience. The showers were great and everyone was extremely helpful and friendly. The neighborhood it’s in is pretty cool and a quick walk from SoHo, Chinatown, NoLita, etc. I’ll definitely stay there again if I need to crash in the city on a budget."
714140,32940875,2021-01-26,"Room size was fine. Clean. Window was left open prior to coming in so the room was freezing cold. One measly blanket that I’m not sure was washed or not but thankfully I had my own. <br/><br/>Bring your own soap, paper towels, sponges, etc because that is not included.<br/><br/>Other people that live in the house are rude, mad racist comments, had the police called on me because I was asking why someone used the dish sponge to clean their shoes, but other than that, great!"
812966,42982053,2021-10-29,"Quedarnos en el departamento con Dwarmis fue una gran decisión. Ella habla español, lo cual nos ayudó a comunicarnos con ella todo el tiempo. El departamento está en una zona accesible de todos los metros y camiones. Es pequeño y se encuentra en el tercer piso pero no tuvimos problema con eso, ya que solo llegábamos a dormir. Todo se encuentra muy limpio y tiene todo lo necesario. Dwarmis es una excelente anfitriona, definitivamente nos quedaremos nuevamente con ella en nuestro siguiente viaje "

554256,21437509,2019-03-10,"Sarah and Andrew are the perfect hosts. They welcomed me and my girlfriend at their place, and despite the very short notice (we reserved on the same day of arrival) everything was absolutely perfect. We stayed 10 days and we felt like we were at home. Andrew cooked an exquisite dinner for us and Sarah gave us the opportunity to try a bit of aerial yoga. She also gave us a ton of suggestions about NYC and the neighbourhood. The apartment location is perfect for those who want to spend time in NYC in a quiet but vibrant area well connected to Manhattan with a 15 min ride by subway. The L line is at 3 minutes walking distance from the house door. Communication with Sarah was amazing throughout. So if you go to NYC my recommendation is stay at Sarah&Andrew’s place because in years of Airbnb this was the first time we found someone’s who really represents what this app was made for."

658262,28500619,2019-05-23,"Over all this was a great stay. My family and I loved it. Anthony was helpful <br/>As we enjoyed the stay, I would mention some things that should be taken care of:<br/>1) the apartment is on the third floor with no elevator. So it is pretty hard, especially with kids and suitcases, to climb it every time. Take that into consideration. <br/><br/>2) some things didn’t work,  that does not work.. such as locks in bathroom doors and dishwasher. <br/><br/>3) cleaning wise - the fridge was full of old food, assumingely from other stays. <br/><br/>I would say the apartment is in the next location. And Overall we had great time."

Very small room - can't fold a suitcase flat. Didn't see the host at all - didn't see *anyone*, actually, though heard people moving about."
576461,22356845,2019-12-28,"We stayed for a week in Timo's apartment during our winter holidays. Overall it was a great experience: the location in downtown brooklyn makes it easier to enjoy both manhattan and brooklyn by foot. There are several subway station around so you can change the routes every day. Considering the room and apartment: it's probably the best airnbnb experience we had in new-york: cozy, cinematic, with a lot of books to look through. And Timo was very nice and friendly so we will definitely try to come back."

Great amenities, food and water, But know that you’re sharing the space with other guests on the same floor (Kay is great and will let you know if and when that happens), so you will be sharing the bathroom and dining/kitchen space."
559341,21620762,2020-02-17,I so appreciated the decor and having Edgar’s art to admire. Fantastic location for Central Park and the trains. And having good coffee and milk available as well as the extra heaters were a lovely bonus!

We parked the car for the weekend and walked everywhere which was ideal. <br/>Will absolutely seek this rental out for our next trip into the city!"
725033,33999874,2021-06-30,"I was very excited for my stay with Meela. On my arrival the room was clean, bright and spacious like the ad says but I was extremely bummed to find out that the door opening to the balcony is locked shut and not able to be used during my stay (this was one the reasons why I booked the room). There was access to the balcony but through the kitchen and this was open to the other guests to use also. I really didn't feel comfortable knowing anyone was able to be right outside my door and see into my room. Also when I arrived I asked one of the ladies who worked there (who was very sweet and nice) if there was another bathroom besides the one outside my room and she said there was another one open downstairs- which was not the funky cool looking one shown in the pictures. I was however very bummed out to find the day before I left that there were actually two other bathrooms in the house that were kept closed (one was being used a storage room downstairs) as the bathroom across from me was closed off for a pest infestation treatment. It did not make sense to me why were told we couldn't use the other bathroom with so many people in the house and I felt the ad was a bit misleading in those instances. Something else to keep in mind even tho it's lightly mentioned in the 'House Rules' is that there are several cameras in the house and you are filmed almost anytime you are not in your room or bathroom. I've lived in several communal living situations and this was by far the cleanest I had ever been in (which I greatly appreciated) however shortly into my stay I received a group message from the host saying that areas were being left messy and if it continued the host would check all the recordings and cancel whoever it was that was leaving the mess. Even though I know I was cleaning up after myself the tone of the that message really put me on edge for the rest of my trip. This room is also right next to the kitchen and gets all the noise coming from there to keep in mind. This is also an old space in New York and during the summer you will most likely see a bug or two (which is common everywhere in the city). The location was great tho and Astoria was really wonderful. Another thing to keep in mind if traveling to Bushwick or spots in Bk it can be very long with the trains and the trains were very messy trying to get home at night (it almost took me 3hrs getting back from BK one night).  All in all I still had a nice stay"
682118,30252034,2021-06-12,Great place! The hostess Wendy is very nice and we had a great time talking about New York and she shared a lot of advice with me!
773366,38286394,2020-03-15,The house was really nice & clean. Beautiful bathroom in master suite. The host was very nice and attentive when I had trouble. Guests in next room were a bit loud but overall I didn’t mind not being alone. Would stay again !
636739,26842735,2019-11-15,"Coco's place is excellent, especially for a solo traveller. It's in a fantastic location - super close to the Meat Packing District and The High Line, but totally central if you want to explore Soho, Tribeca, and the Financial District too. It's also really close to Christopher Street station making it super quick and easy to get up to Midtown. <br/><br/>Coco was a great host - friendly, helpful and very quick to respond! Would highly recommend! :D"

Overall, enjoyed my stay here! <br/><br/>Areas for improvement:<br/>• It was a bummer that the rooftop wasn't available for my stay. Not the host's fault, but I partly booked the place because of that (it was advertised). So I feel like others should know about it too.<br/>• The kitchen light wasn't working and it took a few days to get it fixed. Turns out there was broken wiring behind the wall that could've turned into a dangerous situation. Fortunately, the host acted quick and it got fixed. I wish that was resolved prior to me checking in."
740485,35038426,2021-10-24,very satisfying

413721,14726699,2020-01-23,"Shanie is a phenomenal host.  She met us at the door for check in, showed us the place and made us feel super welcome.  She has everything you need as far as toiletries.  Loads of shampoos, soaps, and even sun block! (for those of you there in the summer).  We found the location wonderful. We could catch the E or J train into Manhattan most anytime and had no trouble with returning even later in the evening.  There are several restaurants within a few minutes walk as well as a pharmacy and minimart.  I would ABSOLUTELY recommend her place and would be happy to stay there again on return to the city.  Thank you again Shanie!"

I would not hesitate to visit her again!"
356696,11927032,2019-10-05,"Nicole and Nathan's apartment was simply perfect, I cannot speak highly enough of their lovely hospitality throughout my stay. We stayed there for a week and the only unfortunately thing about this booking was we were not staying for longer, I would have happily stayed for another week. The apartment was spotless and very fresh and contemporary, bigger than expected and a great size for New York. Nicole was so helpful throughout our stay and a pleasure to speak. The area/street itself felt very safe for us. We got the tube into Manhattan most evenings which is only a 5 minute walk or we grabbed an Uber.  Trains runs constantly so never had to wait long. I cannot praise this apartment enough and I already looking to book again for next year."
690786,31019621,2019-12-08,"Our family had an amazing stay in the suite! Great location, amazing service and beautiful space. Alyssa's quick and thoughtful communications really helped us to feel comfortable with every aspect of our trip. Will definitely be staying here again when we visit NYC!!!"
644852,27528267,2019-05-28,"Recomiendo completamente la casa de Rashmi. Fue la primera vez que tomé un Airbnb y mis expectativas fueron superadas. Rashmi fue muy comunicativo desde el momento que decidí tomar su casa, respondió y resolvió rápidamente mis inquietudes durante la estancia y me ayudó brindándome facilidades extras, como dejar mis maletas en su casa fuera del horario establecido antes de tomar mi vuelo de retorno. El espacio brinda todas las comodidades y privacidad necesarias, y aunque no tiene cocina disponible, en lo particular no sentí falta ya que estuve casi todo el día fuera. Aunque en un inicio el barrio parece ser un poco solitario, en realidad es muy seguro para caminar inclusive en la noche. Gracias Rashmi una vez más a tí y tu novia por todo. Saludos desde Bolivia."

Thank you for your wonderful hospitality! Highly recommend
631446,26327970,2019-07-01,"My son and I had a lovely stay here. Noemi is a wonderful host -- friendly, thoughtful, communicative, and accommodating. It is a basement apartment, but there are windows and good lighting, and the apartment is both spacious and in an excellent location. Parking was easy. It was very helpful to have a kitchen -- and we appreciated (and enjoyed!) the variety of treats that were provided. Thank you, Noemi! :)"

859444,49023623,2021-09-05,"I've stayed at a number of Airbnb's and have had a variety of different experiences as a guest. Unfortunately, this one wasn't a good fit.<br/><br/>I stayed for three weeks in the shared apartment with the host and her roommate. The apartment was fine, the location was good, however the host wasn't upfront and direct in her communication and changed the house rules multiple times over the course of my stay. The result was that I became very uncomfortable using the shared spaces and decided to leave early.<br/><br/>I would recommend this place just for people who need a place to crash at night - not for those staying for an extended period of time."
767439,37594699,2021-07-29,"The family is great. Pol answered my questions in a timely manner, he was kind and very helpful. The family communicated with me on the day of and I was able to check in earlier. His daughter was very sweet, friendly and very informative with places to go, places to try and when to drive lol with NYC traffic. The house was more than I expected, very clean, beds were comfortable. Love the decor. We didn’t use the kitchen but you have all the appliances you need. You can even grill outside. The neighborhood is your typical Queens neighborhood and it didn’t bother us at all, we always felt safe. It has its own parking. The houses are very narrow so it’s very tight space. Each room has an AC unit except one of the rooms so it does get very hot but all the rooms are great. No problems at all. To be honest we spent each day touring the city we literally came home to sleep and it was a great experience I truly have no complaints, they were a very pleasant family and that’s what I read in the reviews and it pushed me to get this Airbnb and I would do it again. You literally have Dublin donuts, some restaurants walking distance and it’s right off the highway. It’s about 20-30 minutes to NYC that’s with traffic. Thank you Pol and family for checking in even after being there a few days, until next time!!!!"

780632,39139580,2020-08-01,A perfect small space with a perfect sized room for one or two people to share. Bed was very comfortable and I was able to work from home without any disturbance. The street it’s self is not the best and would not want to walk at night alone on the street BUT it is close to so many other things that made up for it. The East river was a dream to run along and amazing restaurants around. There are bodegas all over along with anything you would need. Takeshi is one of the nicest humans I have encountered in New York. Great at communicating and very easy going. I would stay at this spot again!
854184,48285942,2021-08-15,The location of this apartment is very ideal. Right in the center of the city and close to nearly all subway lines. I definitely recommend it for that reason; it’s hard to find better in the city. It was a great long term stay!

I wasn't responding because of how packed I was with bags, but I was being attentive. He gave me detailed instructions on how to check-in and all I needed to know about the place. It was definitely an awesome place. The lights are very cool, they make the place feel cooler, intimate, and unique. Me and my friend had a nice time there! The bedsheets are silk which was a huge surprise, I enjoyed it (-: it was very quiet even with other people in the other rooms. We never saw each other so it's pretty private as well. Definitely recommend this place for you and someone else you want to spend time with!"

800076,41326373,2021-11-07,My stay was amazing.  i grew up in that neighborhood. I especially love the culture in that area. As soon as i walked in i smelled familiar foods. I especially like the Creole Restaurant across the street. Everything was so convenient.
533979,20619757,2021-05-09,"This was a perfect place to stay while staying in Brooklyn. It is a very spacious one bedroom... which is a rare finding in NYC. Gabe was always quick to write back and addressed any concerns I had right away. The place is clean, safe, and I was able to find street parking fairly easily. I would definitely stay here again!"
460964,16810808,2020-01-27,"It was adorable and absolutely perfect for visiting my family.  It was cozy, clean and the owners were wonderful!  Great communication every step of the way.  I would definitely book to stay here again while in NY.  Thank you for everything!"
821719,44281187,2021-06-17,"ROACHES! We checked into this place and as soon as we walked in we saw 2 roaches in the bathroom (roaches travel in colonies so who knows how many more were in the walls). Understanding that bugs can sometimes be present, especially in older buildings, we decided to see how the first night would go. The second day, we started seeing more roaches on the floor, kitchen cabinets, and in the bathroom. We immediately left after 1 night (booked for 4) and got a hotel room. Reached out to the host the next day (was late the night we left so waited until the next day) to let them know what happened and they would not offer us a refund for the nights that we did not stay there (showed them proof with photos/videos and receipt of the hotel we booked). They wouldn't even cover the cost of our hotel room that we had to book. Roaches are unacceptable and they can follow you if they get into your bag/clothes (spiders or ants are tolerable but definitely not roaches). We had all of our things immediately washed and dry cleaned. The host was not considerate at all. Their only remedy was to offer us another unit but quite frankly we did not trust that other units would be any different. The overall environment of this building is off putting. I highly recommend getting yourself a hotel room instead of this place. I hope this helps anyone else avoid the situation that we were in."
709033,32611977,2019-07-14,"Arnol's home was very clean, fun, and welcoming!  I highly recommend his place to others.  Any questions about the area---where to visit or eat, get answered.  The outside patio in the back has beautiful flowers and is amazing!"

The inside is both spacious and cozy, and it’s the perfect place to open the windows and listen to the sounds of the city, or spend a quiet evening in reading on the couch. Highly recommend."

Easy to get in with lockbox on the stoop.  L train is a block or so away.  There is a nice coffee shop down the street call ghost coffee.  A couple of nice bars nearby as well.  It was very clean and the shower is large and fantastic.  Plenty of room to put your luggage/clothing and it is only a few steps above street level.  Lots to like!
495693,18615903,2019-02-12,"Kung was an excellent host, and was there to meet me when I arrived. He had plenty of recommendations and even offered me a lift into Manhattan on my last day. The flat is also in an excellent location, with easy access to Williamsburg and Manhattan. There were, however, cleanliness issues, which made the stay less pleasant than it should have been. It is also, unfortunately, difficult to sleep with the cat howling outside your door all night and, whilst Kung offers you earplug, it’s just not ideal."

833088,45906774,2021-03-23,"This was our first time using AB&B in Brooklyn.  Normally we stay with friends, but Covid... Anyway,  we were so glad we decided to stay at Tamara's place.  We were traveling as 2 parents, 1 child and 1 toddler.  Tamara had a pack and play and booster seat for our 18-month-old and there was a space in the entranceway for our stroller. There were even some books and games for our older child.   The inside of the apt was very clean and quiet and had plenty of room for us to spread out with all our luggage.   Outside of the apt, food and subway options were pretty convenient.  We did cook a couple of meals and the kitchen had everything I needed as far as cooking utensils, dishes, etc.  Hopefully once Covid threat is reduced we will be able to stay at our friends again, but if I ever need to ABB again in Brooklyn I will definitely come back here or recommend it to others. Tamara was really helpful with all my previsit questions and so accomodating with our travel circumstances."

Autumn was also extremely communicative and replied very quickly with any questions we had - she's a great host!

13924,56859,2021-11-02,"Wayne was great and very welcoming. <br/>Although we did not take up the offer,  he does offer breakfast in the morning! <br/>I think the only “setback” to this place is location, and even then it wasn’t really that bad, just a little nerve wracking, and the street is very loud at night, but I didn’t mind too much. <br/>Also location is very close to subway, like three blocks. <br/>Overall our stay was great!"
2181,8490,2021-06-17,"A charming stay! Five of us were able to stay comfortably. Outside terrace was such a treat, and there were places to eat/drink coffee within walking distance. Nathalie was communicative about our needs! Appreciated the details in the apartment – furniture, fireplaces, little reading nook. Space was bigger than expected too. We had two cars to find parking for, and it was fine – took some time to find spots at night but was not bad for NY standards at all, were still able to find spots only a few blocks away farthest."
264260,7265079,2019-07-14,"Ming's apartment is in a really booming part of Brooklyn. It is safe, close to many cool shops and restaurants and other amenities (small groceries, Prospect Park, St. Francis Xavier Church, the subway, the bus), and good value for money. <br/><br/>The host is a kind, thoughtful, funny, and helpful person who will surely become your friend by the end of your stay. Ming provided us with all that we needed and beyond! She is truly deserving of superhost status. She was also super accommodating of me when I lost my phone on our last night in New York. <br/><br/>Will definitely come back to Ming's in the future! Highly recommended place."

Aber für den jenige die sich Auto leihen weder ich diese Ort liebe abraten, weil auch wenn du deine Auto richtig packst, bekommst du trotzdem einen Strafzettel und das schönste daran ist, sie wissen wann du ankommst. Am 03.10.2019 ich bin recht spät in das Unterkunft angekommen aber es gab einen privat Auto, Marke Mercedes, die extra gewartet hat das ich ankomme und parken tue, damit er mir einen Strafzettel verpasst, obwohl auf der Straße es gab einen Schild ( parken verboten am Mittwoch zwischen 9.30 -11.00 h ) , und ich war erst ab Donnerstag da. Die Frage ist vielmehr von wo wussten sie an welchen Tag ich ankomme. Jeder soll für sich entscheiden."

545444,21038471,2020-02-16,Very disappointed with this stay the sheets were dirty and smelled funny so I had to buy my own. The first night I was here the heat wasn’t working and outside was about 38° so my company and I were cold. Second night here we had heat but I realize that my company and I weren’t  alone they were mice running in and out the room.  Not only in the room but one ran on my boyfriend’s foot while he was in the bathroom. This room came with both a mini fridge and microwave which gave me the impression that It would be okay to eat it here. Between these  two night the house smelled like smoke and peppermint like someone was trying to cover up the smell. I was very disappointed with this stay even thought it’s a lovely home it’s not as clean as I would of hoped for

45028,294490,2021-08-09,"The Box Hotel was amazing and worth the price for a short stay! Check in was quick and easy. All the staff in the hotel were very kind. The room was accurately shown. Super spacious. Beds were pretty comfortable. Bathroom had a good amount of space. There were 3 - 4 people staying in the room throughout the weekend, and it did not feel congested at all. We each had our own space to get ready. The room is decorated with a lot of mirrors and a full length mirror in the bathroom, so if you are a group of ladies that take your time with hair and makeup it works out. Floor was clean. We were able to park on the street next to the hotel and our car was safe the whole weekend. The signs around the hotel asked that guest wore mask, but they didn’t seem overly strict about it. The walls are a bit thin and we were able to hear music from a wedding on the roof top so that is something to keep in mind. All in all great stay and I would stay here again!"

The neighbors were friendly and our stay was relaxing. The apartment worked great for our needs in Astoria— a quiet place to retreat to after a long day. AC & fan kept the place cool and comfortable at night in the summer heat wave!"
613256,24879207,2021-07-01,Kathryn’s home is the epitome of comfort. My girlfriend and I had an enjoyable 4 day stay. Plenty of kitchen space to cook. There’s also great outdoor space that I used to work outside. Would recommend this home for any NYC resident looking to get out of the city and closer to the waves. The private beach up the street is a nice addition to the stay. The home also isn’t too far from the public beaches. Would easily stay here again.
858569,48932972,2021-08-07,"Great location in the heart of Harlem! We had some great food on Restaurant Row, meeting some awesome local business owners. Loved it. The wine shop that Ricardo recommended nearby was exceptional. We were 2 single adults and 2 kids and we all fit perfectly. One kid loved the air mattress! <br/><br/>Close to so many subway lines and Central Park made it really convenient. The street is lively at all hours, which we loved and once inside, really didn’t hear much noise at night. For the value, we were quite pleased and with just a few more personal touches, Ricardo will surely be raising his prices soon! He warns you about the stairs and that is no joke. The stairs are brutal after a long day touring but these 2 southern ladies survived! <br/><br/>Don’t wait to reserve this. It was awesome to be in Harlem while visiting NYC!"

The apartment was well cleaned and there were numerous amenities—sanitizers, towels, toiletries, snacks, masks. I especially appreciated having full access to their kitchen. Pots, pans, bowls, plates, cups, spoons, etc were all available to use, making me save money as I could actually cook instead of buying out! They also offered a cute little pantry of sorts that was assorted with coffee, snacks, and quick breakfast pick me ups. The overall atmosphere that Mackenzie provided was great, relaxing, and welcoming. I would love to stay here again :)"

They even left us some toothbrushes which was so nice of them. The location is great, you can sometimes hear an ambulance or two given the proximity of the hospital but it was never anything that caused issues. There are so many restaurants, bars and shops in walking distance and the train is less than a block away. Definitely a great spot to stay."

640511,27188155,2019-10-29,Appartement idéalement situé dans un quartier très vivant et très central de Manhattan. <br/>Déco typiquement New Yorkaise et minimaliste. <br/>Les photos restituent très bien l’appartement. <br/>Salle de douche et cuisines minuscules mais chambre et salon spacieux (surtout pour NY !) et très agréables. <br/>Un excellent séjour ! Merci.
467736,17257339,2019-05-06,Four of us stayed in Paul’s place for the 5-Boroughs ride.  Location was perfect and Paul has gone out of his way to make this a special place.  Will absolutely book again.
539648,20819020,2019-11-18,"Carla is a very nice host. I did not meet her husband.  <br/>The room is smaller then it seems in the picture and the closet was locked when I was there, so I did not have a place to hang the clothes I needed during my stay.  Not enough space on the floor to keep the suitcase open while using the room either, unless in bed.  No designated place in the bathroom for my towel and clothes while in the shower, the livingroom off limits. I felt that my presence was a nuisance.<br/>The room is right next to the entrance door, and adjacent to the bathroon, which is convenient.  However, there is no door between this part of the apartment and the livingroom.  The second night, very tired after a day in the outdoors, I went to sleep early but was unable to fall asleep for a long time due to the fact that the TV was on.<br/>The room was clean. The bathroom was clean, but had a white rug, which on day two was no longer clean."
861670,49242295,2021-10-12,"Great place to stay! Right by  L and J line, so great location. The host was so gracious and went out of her way to accommodate us! I enjoyed my stay so much and would stay again!"

760385,36963544,2021-11-07,This is an amazing comfortable space makes you feel just like home the hosts are kind and considerate it’s close to everything

794048,40634707,2019-12-08,"The pictures of this place are accurate, only it is even cuter in real. It is clean and the attention to detail was well thought out for the comfort of the guests. The hosts were informative and prompt to reply, and the check in process was very easy. My wife and I would recommend this apartment-would've loved to stay longer. Maybe next time."
95353,1009883,2021-11-07,"Lovely place. Jana was easy to communicate with. Beautiful, clean, sparkling new interior with wonderful quiet location not far from many cafes. Comfy mattress. The cat is sweet. Loved our stay here and would highly recommend."
556582,21550242,2019-12-27,"The apartment is a beautiful Oasis in the middle of Brooklyn! Very cutely decorated and lots of hanging plants. It was a great size with a full kitchen and big bedroom (down the hall from the living area & kitchen) plus a normally sized full bath (shower only, but spacious and good if you're tall!). It is a noisy street but the bedroom is in the back of the apartment which helped a lot. It's next to the subway but also not a far walk to take the ped path across the  Williamsburg bridge into Manhattan, which is what we did. We were able to walk to a lot of restaurants (vegan heaven- Loving Hut & Champs Diner are super close) and there are a ton of little markets and coffee shops just outside the door. A word of caution that there are two sets of narrow, steep steps to reach the apartment so if you have mobility issues or don't pack light it might be an issue. In terms of parking, we didn't have much problem finding space on a nearby street (just be mindful of signs for street sweeping etc.) We moved the car a couple of times to see family and to get to places in Brooklyn too far to walk to; we always found parking in other neighborhoods and when we returned.  Overall a very nice place!"
858990,48960986,2021-08-17,"If I could give Paul 10 stars I would. To say Paul is an amazing host is an understatement. Paul went above and beyond his duties as a host to make my stay comfortable and enjoyable. Anything I needed and more he was there. Whether it was a ride to work or just a check in to make sure I was okay, he made himself available at all times. He is one of the kindest, most attentive hosts you will ever come across. The studio was also great! It had everything I needed during my 3 month stay and it was very homey. If there was something I needed or wanted during my stay, Paul made sure to provide it. I always felt safe and comfortable during my stay and it truly felt like my home away from home for 3 months. The neighborhood has a laundromat a 2 minute walk away, a corner store less than a block away, and the subway was a 7 minute walk away. Everything was very conveniently located. I can’t recommend this studio enough and anyone who stays at one of Paul’s listings will have an amazing experience. Thank you Paul for everything!"
659577,28606376,2019-04-29,The host canceled this reservation 20 days before arrival. This is an automated posting.

From water, to an umbrella for a rainy day, to directions and subway advice, he is a knowledgeable, always available, and friendly resource. <br/>The neighborhood is quiet and it’s a straight 5 minute walk to the subway station to take you directly into Manhattan. We felt safe, comfortable, and very happy to have found Geoffrey’s place. We will stay here on future trips if possible and highly recommend it to anyone taking a trip to NY. <br/>Note: I’m female, was traveling alone with a teen daughter, and we felt totally safe and comfortable here, which is always an important consideration for me when traveling. :)  Thank you, Geoffrey, for a great stay!"

663519,28913606,2019-05-12,"This place was great! Standard hotel king room with mini fridge and big flat screen! Bigger than every hotel room I have been in within NYC. The team did everything in their power to make this a great stay. The location was top notch as well. Many restaurants nearby, small grocery store on the corner,  and grand central just a few blocks away. We walked to Central Park and many other attractions but the subway is a great option as well. Will come back to this location again in the future!!"
882343,51539699,2021-10-17,"The place abd the room was large and perfect for a NY apt. The location is close to the metro and other forms of public transportation. <br/>Luba is very nice, and has prepared eveything for her guests -- a detailed list of things to do nearby, A small kitchen specifically for guests, closet space, and other amenities that you don't expect like shampoo and a shoe rack!!<br/><br/>Satisfied for a weekend trip and probably for a future longer trip"

855385,48489781,2021-05-08,"We really enjoyed our stay in Harvin's place and would stay here again. The location is great and really close to a subway stop. And even with that the street is relatively quiet. The sofa + loveseats setup is suuuuuper helpful for rainy days in the unit. Harvin was very responsive in general, and was able to let us into the unit before normal check in time when I didn't read the description correctly in advance, which was very appreciated.<br/><br/>Some things to be prepared for:<br/>The blinds in the bedroom (which faces the street) don't even get close to pulling down all the way, so you get to exercise your exhibitionism if that's what you're into. If you're not, there is some stock art in hallway that fits into the frame great.<br/><br/>BYO soap, any of the stores next door have some.<br/><br/>The remote was broken and there's only one button on the tv to control all functions, so using it was an exercise.<br/><br/>The blinds in the main living area are the glue on paper type blinds so opening and closing them is not a thing to be undertaken lightly.<br/><br/>A toilet seat bolt was broken (this is a very small thing) so it slides around everywhere. Use that core girl.<br/><br/>Again would definitely recommend staying here. Love the location, love the seating."
607357,24427558,2021-07-19,"While it’s a cheap hotel in a great location, I had a hard time with the strong smell of pot in the building. It gave me a horrible headache the whole visit : (<br/><br/>I would suggest, only stay if you’re 420 friendly and you like the smell."
225514,5406041,2019-04-17,"Great place and location - Cara is a proper New Yorker and the whole neighborhood feels authentically New York (as opposed to touristy). Of course there is also easy access to the tourist locations by Subway. Cara is very welcoming and trusting. She was away most of the time while we were there, and basically trusted us with her entire house, letting us use the kitchen, washing machine etc. There is plenty of space in the room for two people and a separate bathroom which is nice. Would definitely go again!"

The downstairs (the bedroom) was a little disappointing...quite dark and a little unfinished (unpainted floor on the stairs, with a hole in the wall covered up by a piece of paper). We enjoyed the home nonetheless but that was definitely a little inaccurate in the description."

341873,10807838,2020-09-08,"This is not my first time staying in Mr. Barry's house and I'm sure not the last one. Mr. Barry is an extraordinary host who is available 24/7 for his guests if any concern or question arises. The rooms are always tidy, Mr. Barry does the cleaning of amenities and hallways every day, making sure that guests are happy and satisfied to the full extent. There are enough free parking spots near the house. The community is safe and quiet. <br/>I enjoyed staying in Mr. Barry's house again and will book this place next time if it is available."
873875,50494788,2021-11-04,Great place.
605227,24306539,2020-01-21,My stay at this apartment was fine. It was a decent enough place to come back to after sightseeing. The room was trendy but quite small and cluttered with stuff though so I would probably go for somewhere else next time. The location was very good and we were able to use the kitchen - however I did find cockroaches in one cupboard where the tea and coffee is kept which needs to be sorted out. <br/><br/>I have to mention that I got the impression that there is more than one person running this apartment. When I couldn’t open the lockbox to get the key I messaged on the app and then called the number when I didn’t get a response. Luckily Jackie said he was at home and let me in but I then got a message 15 minutes later on the app asking me if I got in which seemed like it came from someone other than the person who let me in. <br/><br/>I also noticed when looking through Airbnb options for this trip that there was another apartment very similar to this one which is run by ‘Jack’ who has the exact same bio as Jackie. I also might be mistaken but based on the host photos I think it was the Jack from the other apartment that let me in not the Jackie who is meant to be the host for this one.<br/><br/>If it is the case that two people are running these two apartments together and are there interchangeably then I don’t think it’s necessarily a problem. However I think it would be best to be upfront about it so as to avoid people getting confused or creeped out. I don’t mean to cause offence because the host that I met seemed nice and friendly and my stay in the apartment was fine - I just wanted to give this feedback.
76382,764753,2019-05-03,"Ficamos no apartamento de Jenny e José por 27 dias. Ele é espaçoso, bem localizado (a poucas quadras do metrô - fácil acesso a Manhattan).

Foi uma experiência incrível!"

There’s a Whole Foods nearby with a delicious burger bar and a Barnes and Noble that serves Starbucks coffee. Fabulous! We could easily walk to the 9/11 Memorial, Wall Street, Battery Park and many lovely shops. We could also easily catch the subway to visit all the tourist sights. <br/>Don’t hesitate to book.

414154,14760211,2019-11-30,Location in upper East Side of New York City ideal for getting around the city for both business and pleasure.

Kian prépare de petites attentions pour ses guests (bouteilles d’eau et de mocha Starbucks dans le frigo) et est réactif pour répondre aux messages.  Idéal pour un séjour dans New York."

The apartment is beautiful and stylish and it was absolutely spotless. Andrew is the perfect host; he provided us with a lot of info with regards to the local area and was on hand to answer any questions we had, but he respected our privacy and we didn’t feel crowded. Probably the best Airbnb experience I’ve had! Thanks Andrew :)"

The place is about a 10 minute walk to the D line, so you'll be in Manhattan within 30 minutes tops. There is also a ferry stop which is about 2 miles away, we recommend you doing that. The ferry ride is only $2.75 and you'll get really close to the Statue of Liberty and the ride will take you to Wall St. We recommend this place if you're a budget traveler that doesn't care about the fancy stuff, just a clean and quiet place to sleep with a place to shower."

Definitely had a homey feeling for our family of 4. He also went the extra mile to lend a helping hand when our car battery went dead after sitting a couple days with the light on. He was very responsive and friendly.

780357,39114301,2019-12-12,"Steve and his partner were very friendly hosts. The location cannot be beat for easy access to Manhattan and other neighborhoods in BK. The private bathroom was super clean and spacious. The bedroom was a little tight and the bed is a bit springy, but it's a perfect crash-pad for a couple of nights. Great value and friendly hosts!"
848225,47446558,2021-03-02,"Very clean, quite and peaceful. Every time I’m here I never want to leave. It’s a new building and very stylish. Great super-host. 5 stars!!!"
734439,34443205,2019-07-08,"From the beginning I really appreciate how quickly Annette responded to my inquiries. The house was great. My family and I really enjoyed the amount of space, the cleanliness and the fully equipped kitchen and bath rooms. My kiddos also appreciated the computer and the backyard sitting area. The beds were comfortable, there were plenty of towels and blankets for our use also. The kitchen is well equipped but the ice maker or water dispenser was not functioning properly. The location is great also, you have a wonderful view right down the street of Manhattan and parts of Brooklyn and there is a little part you can walk out on rocks and sit by the water. There is also a bus stop on the corner but we choose to use the free Ferry most of our trip which you will need to drive to and pay to park or catch the bus. Even though the Ferry is not walking distance it is by far the best means of transportation for the going to Manhattan or Brooklyn. Their are grocery stores and convenient shops nearby but they are a little more on the expensive side. If you can get to Jersey there is a Walmart. I was a little sadden that there wasn't coffee or we were not able to use the water from the ice maker at the house. <br/>There was a hiccup with checking in as we could not get a hold of the tenant who lives in the basement of the house and completes your check in and let us in the house. The next door neighbor eventually was able to assist and came to our rescue. Also the thermostat was locked away so you have to wait on the tenant in the basement to adjust the temperature which he did not ask us what we would like it set to he just takes it upon himself to self regulate and then he locks it back. Needless to say we had to contact him several times about it.  Also the bathtub does not have a bath tub stopper which made baths impossible for the baby. We called the basement host and although he came by he  did not know what to do so e assumed he would contact the host r heard anything  it .  it. Also we asked him a few questions about the city and he was not very helpful."

145736,2334411,2019-05-01,The apartment was very clean and very well located; it was also quite peaceful at night. Yacine and Brenda allow you to drop luggage off early on arrival and to store it on departure which can be a real bonus if you have heavy suitcases in tow. Queries were always responded to quickly: in short I would recommend them - thank you Yacine and Brenda.

Ci ha indicato come arrivare alla casa e ci ha dato le istruzioni in modo molto dettagliato. <br/>Anche quando non sapevo come usare la macchina del caffé mi ha risposto subito e ho bevuto un ottimo cappuccino.<br/>Sono attenzioni che secondo me fanno la differenza. <br/>Abbiamo trovato una camera sicura pulita e accogliente. <br/>Nell'appartamento c'erano altri ospiti, ma é stata anche questa un'esperienza del tutto positiva, perché abbiamo potuto conoscere altre persone che si sono rivelate anche loro molto cordiali.<br/>La posizione dell'appartamento é ottima perché molto vicino alla metro e ai mezzi. Harlem é un quartiere affascinante e pieno di vita."

It's also a huge plus that it was close to the metro. We stayed out late every night for the entire duration of our trip and did not encounter any problems while walking from the metro to Aswad's place.

If I am ever in the area I will be checking their availability. <br/><br/>I was in town for a Saint John’s University graduation and they are just minutes from the campus and on my way to the campus, I could hit a coffee and a bagel shop. Perfect for that extra energy you’re gonna need for packing up your Seniors’ dorm. <br/><br/>Thank you once again, for a very accommodating visit."
823409,44477235,2021-05-16,Had a great time at the location De provided. The apartment was very clean and was very spacious. Would definitely book again. The only thing that was a bit of a nuisance was the rowdy neighborhood. Shouting and drunken curses could be heard throughout the night. Being on the first floor did not help in that regard. Overall great time though.
502069,18975097,2019-09-29,"This is my 2nd time here and it’s wonderful! The area is so beautiful and the room itself is super cozy & comfortable. William and Joseph always responded very quick and were very kind, definitely recommend this place to anyone! :)"

They were very nice.
789427,40035744,2021-10-13,"The room is very clean and the bed is very comfortable along with the accommodations.  The host is helpful and readily available.  The only thing that wasn't mentioned was that she has a young pet that is often moving through the accessible areas, so if you don't want to encounter a barking puppy that wants attention, this might not be your ideal choice.  The neighborhood is quiet with great access to public transit and parking wasn't a problem on the street."

760858,36998345,2019-09-12,The place was perfect and Dusan is a really great host. I had trouble accessing my airbnb account when I got to New York and he still went out of way to accommodate me. If I'm ever back in Brooklyn I'd stay here again without a doubt.
700101,31760941,2019-12-26,"Overall an amazing experience. Private entrance and overall safe. Walking distance from the laundry mat which was great! Located 5-8 minutes from subway station.

Moa (a great local gem of a coffee shop) is right around the corner, as are all the restaurants on 30th Ave. You are on the ground floor, but it's a quiet block, and the building itself is nice and pretty quiet. I'd definitely stay here again!"

182584,3835681,2019-08-20,"Très bon accueil. La chambre est très bien, l'appartement est très propre. L'emplacement est un peu en dehors de Manhattan mais le métro est très proche et c'est très facile de rejoindre le centre, même le soir et sans risque. Astoria est également très mignon comme coin, avec une piscine gratuite et superbe en plein air à quelques minutes de chez Angelo. Je recommande à 100%"

455849,16613394,2019-05-29,"Joseph is a really nice person. He is communicative and warm-heart. The house is much better than the pictures of Airbnb. Also, the house is in a good location which has a subway station towards Manhattan."
843763,46985961,2021-06-07,"Staff was friendly but there were a few things wrong with the room. The shower head was leaking and when showering, the hose was spewing water out in a few different directions. The rain shower head had rust on it and the shower door would not close. Lastly in the bathroom, the toilet seat hinges were broken and the seat moved as you sat. For the main room, the curtains had dark brown stains (presumably coffee) all over them and the floors were very dirty with coffee sugar packets under the bed. Over all, the room was dirty and not satisfactory. We have photos and documentation of all of this and reported it to the front desk immediately after it was observed. I would not recommend staying here unless it was a much cheaper price."
680367,30129734,2019-10-12,Ayana was very pleasant hostess. She greeted us on arrival even though we had a delay and arrived  later than expected and was attentive during our stay. The space was very clean and cozy.

667926,29230470,2019-09-21,"Apartment was super clean, has all amenities needed. While the location here is fantastic and is within walking distance to main attractions and conveniences of the city, the lack of noise in previous reviews for this location was misleading. The walls are quite thin and the neighbors blast music and believe the fire escape (that is outside your bedroom window) is their own private balcony to discuss their issues from 1am to 6am. With that being said, this may be great for someone who will be out during those times."
789195,39987747,2020-07-17,This was a great stay! Loved this neighborhood and the apartment has a lot of beautiful interior design and art books. Hosts are very nice and responsive to any questions I had.

706118,32406935,2021-08-15,"The space isn't anything fancy or anything that has much of a vibe but if you are looking for a place to stay in Brooklyn that can accommodate a lot of people for cheap, look no further.  It has all the bear essentials and for the price point can't be beat. Lakisha was very friendly and accommodating. Perfect for the bachelor party we had there!"
207991,4605840,2019-05-09,"Suzanne’s place is light and airy, very large for a NYC area apartment. She is the consummate host. Flowers, snacks, breakfast foods, she takes very good care of her guests. Bedstuy is relatively new to us, but we love it. This is our third or fourth time staying with Suzanne. This is definitely our go to place in NY."

Their home is in a prime location that has everything near by. (walking distance to shopping malls, supermarkets and super close to the subway station) Thank you Rachel for everything!"
120448,1654623,2021-10-19,"Exactly what is listed- not super fancy but definitely clean and comfy, and worth the value. I liked having a desk and chair near the window to do work at, and the bed was way comfier than I expected! I can be picky about bathrooms and their cleanliness, but this was one of the nicest bathrooms I’ve seen. The neighborhood felt super safe even when I had late nights. Plus, there’s a cute cat that hangouts downstairs (I’m allergic and didn’t have any problem). What’s not to love??"
811142,42741731,2020-06-27,Thanks for hosting us!

I am also thankful for Yvette’s help in letting me to drop off my luggage early in the morning the first day I arrived at NYC.  This started my short vacation there wonderfully!"
588876,23154138,2020-01-12,"El apartamento es mucho mejor de lo que se ve en la fotos! Es grande y espacioso. Estuvimos 22 días y nos sentimos como en casa, hay mucho espacio para guardar cosas y todo lo que se puede necesitar para una experiencia agradable. La cama es súper cómoda así como el sillón para relajarse y mirar alguna película al final de un largo día. El barrio es seguro y hermoso, nos enamoramos de él! Hay bares muy lindos a apenas una cuadra, supermercados muy buenos a unas tres cuadras y un deli en la esquina. Hemos vuelto a las 2 am sin ningún inconveniente. Hay una estación de metro a dos cuadras con la que se puede estar en Time Square en 10 min. Rosella es encantadora y nos recibió y despidió en persona. Volveríamos sin duda!! Ojalá podamos hacerlo en el futuro."
241272,6224336,2019-07-13,This is a great location and you feel like you are home!  You could spend your entire trip in the neighborhood and not see or do everything offered!  I will definitely stay here again on my next trip to New York!

699103,31684570,2019-05-12,"Such an amazing apartment! There was tons of space, and it was decorated beautifully and very clean. Tessa was such a good host and responded very quickly (we had no problems checking in/out or during our stay). The location was a little out of the way for restaurants/ shops/ subway stops, but the area felt safe and the apartment was worth it. Really recommend this place !!"
773291,38282162,2020-01-02,"Jk was really nice! He responded very quickly and had a great hospitality! The room was clean and a little bit spacious than I thought.

887134,52129213,2021-10-18,Joe had a rude attitude from the time I walked in the door! Denied me my room and still 1 week later refused to send me a refund! A completely horrible experience after driving 6+ hours to visit NEW YORK! The lady who works behind the desk has a nasty habit of talking over you  and getting defensive or acting like you’re attacking them. The customer service is horrible! Will never attempt to stay here again!
660522,28692232,2019-01-14,Everything was good . Just no paper towels.
360741,12272376,2020-07-21,"If you don’t like having a fun and unique experience, this isn’t the stay for you. BUT, if you like trying new things and being adventurous all while conveniently located near some of the best beaches in NY, then definitely give the James Franco a try! <br/><br/>Because it’s a houseboat, there are some particulars that you have to mind (water and gas connections/toilet fun) but Ben is there for you every step of the way. He’s super responsive, and lives practically next door if ever you need anything. <br/><br/>It has a stocked kitchen with pans and pots and a coffee machine as well. The interior was quirky and weird and delightful. Take advantage of the lovely deck in the morning and evenings— we caught some wonderful sunsets on our stay. <br/><br/>All in all, a lovely stay— especially if you’re looking for something out of the ordinary :)"
333875,10280549,2019-04-14,"Laura's place is in a great location close to the Beverly Rd subway, an easy ride up to the Brooklyn Museum or into Manhattan. We had an upstairs bedroom that was very comfortable with a shared bathroom. Would stay again!"

537145,20710208,2021-05-23,"Jenny and Mark’s space was great! We were in town for a family member’s graduation, and it was the perfect place for our base camp. It was HOT when we came, so it was great that AC was available. Depending on where we were going in Manhattan, trains took 30 to 45 minutes."
412079,14685187,2021-06-27,"Ashley and Vadim were great hosts, and so was their adorable cat, Bella! The location is great: close to the subway and only a 15 min ride into lower Manhattan. They were very communicative and helpful and the room itself had everything I needed. The bed was so comfortable! I had a great stay and highly recommend booking this room."
741296,35085826,2020-09-17,"This is a nice stay as shown on the photos. Geri responds quickly. The kitchen has everything you need from a toaster oven to a coffee maker with some snacks as well as coffee/tea. It also includes a washer and dryer. Just be aware that the fridge is a small size as the ones in hotels so you can only place a limited amount of food inside. Also, with it being a basement studio you can mildly hear the family walking and talking above when they are home but once everyone goes to bed, it is pretty peaceful. The bed was comfortable and I slept well. Overall the neighborhood was quiet. I enjoyed my stay!"
576266,22350243,2019-01-04,Very nice place with great view of nyc in big porch

25433,123784,2021-09-28,Excellent location! Close to shopping and restaurants on a quiet shaded street. Bus and train are very close and with a little help from the GPS on my phone both were very easy to navigate. 10/10 would recommend!
873814,50488977,2021-07-18,Not worth. Dirty and unpleasant to stay there. I would rather have used my 130$ at a regular motel/hotel if I could see the place beforehand.
640649,27201242,2019-08-12,"Hemos pasado 5 dias en Brookyn en casa de Mansura y Rafael siendo una familia de 4 personas. Son sin duda unos excelentes anfitriones, atentos, disponibles, generosos y de fácil conversación. La casa se ajusta a la perfección a la descripción, es muy cómoda para una familia de 4 personas, las camas son confortables, el menaje es de buena calidad, la ducha es maravillosa, los toiletries muy agradables y cuidan pequeños detalles como flores naturales en todas las habitaciones .Además Mansura y Rafael  se ocuparon de dejarnos ciertas cosas en la nevera lo que llegando cansados y con niños se agradece. Las conexiones a Manhattan son fáciles y nos recomendaron ciertas cosas que no vienen en las guías. Nos hubiéramos quedado más días en su casa, lo hemos pasado genial."
576500,22356845,2021-09-07,"Timo was a gracious and easy to communicate with host. The location itsself is easy to miss if you don't look for the number, however do not be put off by the exterior. Once inside my room it was wonderfully decorated with thoughtful touches like mints, earplugs and a welcome packet with numerous helpful tips and recommendations for the area. The room had a real urban vibe to it perfect for the location. Timo is a charming host and the room is perfect for solo travellers or a couple. It is also super close to anything you could possibly need."

Everyone was friendly in the neighborhood when we walked around.  The walk to the subway station wasn’t far and we were able to explore New York just through public transportation.  We loved our stay and definitely recommend!"

291045,8398955,2019-04-30,"Where can I start, Laura was one of the best hosts I’ve had with any of my Airbnb’s! She was so kind and helpful in any situation. About the home, it is so conveniently located. It has everything that you need to make your stay comfortable. We stayed for one month, so it felt truly like home when we left. Nearby there’s some amazing restaurants, grocery stores, and it is located 1 min from the Q49 bus that takes you directly to the metro. There is also good street parking, just park before 3 pm and it’s super easy to find a spot. The private entrance was great, it made us feel better when arriving late at night knowing we weren’t bothering anyone. If you are looking for a simple simple place to stay, with great amenities, for a CHEAP price....this is the place to book!"

141070,2151479,2021-08-02,"Rhonda’s place is so nice and clean! Such an awesome neighborhood, close to the trains, and lots to see and do. Rhonda is definitely not your typical host. She takes the time to show you around the apartment, how everything works, and even tells you a little around the neighborhood if you’re not familiar. Communicated very effectively! Would definitely stay again."

Great location near the subway, beautiful and clean apartment with everything you need and Isaac's local recommendations of things to do/places to eat were spot on. The area looks a bit rough and ready at first glance, but we didn't have any issues at all whilst we were there. The street is a tad noisy during the day, but didn't hear a thing at night. Would definitely look to stay here again next time we visit NYC!"

She was like a cool aunt who shared with us popular neighborhood haunts, like Silvana’s, a late night music spot. We also tried a vegan restaurant which was delicious!

I had a pleasant stay at Barry's place and would definitely recommend it; you get a lot for your money."
713487,32886967,2019-10-21,"Vinny is a great host. Very thoughtful and always making you feel like you are at home. The room is  comfortable and warm. There is a single bed. The apartment is located in a part of Astoria that is just packed with great restaurants and stores, but that is peaceful and quiet at night. A short walk away from the N Train terminal, it's very convenient if you are looking to visit Manhattan often. You share the bathroom with the one or two guests who may be staying in the other room, and with Vinny himself. There is always cereal and coffee, and you can use the kitchen in case you feel like cooking. I can recommend this place for solo travelers who are looking for a nice place in NYC at an affordable price. Thanks, Vinny!"

431551,15543090,2019-04-28,"Don’t listen to the other reviews. This place is exactly how it says it is, very clean, nice amenities, walls are thin, yes, you can hear people, yes, but that’s not Michaels fault right? If you decide to stay in a “Private room” then you get what you paid for... an Airbnb with others staying there. Other than that, I’m staying for 3 more days and the location is PERFECT. Thankyou Michael for such a sweet space to stay in."

885189,51910544,2021-11-06,We visited NY for the first time and we were very pleased with the location of this hotel. Subway station is 3 blocks away and it was very easy to get around. The hotel room is small but very nice. On our last night we experienced some very loud neighbors playing music at 2am which was a very unfortunate situation giving our really nice stay. Hotel staff was able to resolve the situation.

575986,22345209,2019-04-19,"This apartment is in a perfect location to see New York. However, we felt as if we were imposing on the host who was quite nosy with the thin walls. The bedroom was clean and as expected quite small. The shared bathroom wasn’t really clean enough for my liking."
592623,23483266,2019-05-22,"The place was great, except there’s no lamp but the one on the ceiling. Also a waterbed, which got quite warm overnight since the room has no air conditioner. The two bathrooms came in handy, the place was clean and the neighborhood just great, awesome food and vibes, very cheap and just fun.<br/><br/>I would suggest to bring earplugs since the backyard was loud at night, people were doing some kind of sale/storage stuff behind the house. Though that’s nothing what Eduardo could against. <br/><br/>All in all a good and fun experience! Would def recommend!"

Greenwich village is a super cool area and Jays apartment is basically in the middle of it. Also, if you like geology, this apartment will rock your world . The only downside is that the  apartment is kept at a balmy temperature of 1670 degrees at all times ;) Really enjoyed the stay, and my friend Chris Barbour now has a man crush on Jay. Would recommend."

The bed was comfortable. There is a cat, but when she heard i was allergic, she kept him in her room. She made us a great breakfast!

El vuelo se retrasó, llegamos de madrugada y no hubo problema en la entrada. Nos recomendó sitios muy chulos cercanos y la zona estaba muy bien situada. En cuanto a la habitación y la casa, quedamos muy agustos, nos sentíamos como en casa. Lo recomiendo 100%"

611296,24756139,2021-11-02,The best host I ever ask for. Comunication with Alexandra was great.
361195,12307809,2019-04-12,"Shelia's place was perfect launching pad as we explored NYC with our 13 year old grandson who kept saying how much he liked ""our home away from home"".  Convenient grocery store a block away next to Walgreens.  We also enjoyed authentic NY pizza at Luigi's on 5th Ave.  A bit of a walk, but well worth it!"

Gates Avenue station is a 5 minute walk and you can be in Manhattan on the J or Z in less than 30 minutes. Queens and Williamsburg are very nearby with lots happening. <br/><br/>Check in was a breeze and the communication and hospitality were second to none. <br/><br/>Oh, there is a great deli nearby on Patchen Avenue. The Colonial hero is awesome. <br/><br/>An all around great stay. Highly recommended!!"

The pictures looked soo perfect that I thought for sure they had been a bit altered.. ABSOLUTELY NOT!! Everything was perfect. From the fresh fragrance, to the sparkling clean Everything, me and my family were sooo blown away. Gabriel and Aquanna were very available to any of our needs or inquires, and to them I am very thankful. Location was perfect, space was perfect and atmosphere was perfect.. I rate it a 100% !! Needless to say we will be back in NYC and there is no way I wouldn’t stay here again! ❤️"

643367,27453970,2019-06-07,"El departamento es cómodo y ubicado muy cercano a una estación de metro. Justo debajo hay un café de excelente calidad.<br/><br/>El barrio no nos pareció tan seguro como se anuncia, especialmente al llegar de noche. Una noche quedamos en medio de una pelea callejera al salir del metro y no fue agradable claramente. Creo que de todos los lugares en que estuvimos en NYC fue la zona en que sentimos mayor inseguridad, lamentablemente."
205305,4532913,2021-05-12,Great place to stay! Awesome location and the room was very cozy
600053,23894317,2019-06-30,Staying with Brian and Kristal was such a pleasure. They were amazingly polite and helpful host. The place was really clean and nice and few steps away from the subway station. I would recommend this place.
870191,50027063,2021-10-07,"This is the second time we stayed in Silva's apartment. The quality is consistent - spacious and clean, with all the amenities you need and a few more added since last stay. This time we have more time strolling in the neighborhood enjoying the restaurants and cafes. The location and access to subways is superb. Silva is very nice and accommodating. This is a real gem in the Upper West area."

Il est spacieux. La douche est agréable et le lit est confortable. L’appartement est au calme. Le logement est à 15 minutes à pied du métro. Deux lignes pour aller à Mannathan en 30 minutes. Les flops : aucun ustensile de cuisine pour manger ou cuisiner simplement. Juste deux assiettes, verres, fourchettes, couteaux, petites cuillères et une casserole. <br/>Donc très réduit. On a laissé un commentaire à Felicia en fin de séjour et elle nous a répondu qu’elle aurait apporté tout ce dont nous aurions besoin si nous lui avons demandé. En dépit du problème de cuisine, nous recommandons ce logement."
890684,52826514,2021-10-24,"This is a lovely apartment, perfect for two people. Big open area, great for relaxing. It's set up well for working if you have to. Really nice neighborhood. Mike is super responsive and made check-in and out seamless. Would definitely stay here again."

848099,47433042,2021-10-04,The house was clean. Nicely updated. I did not read the description closely about no TVs or kitchen. I need to pay more attention to things. <br/><br/>I couldn’t get the air to work and felt a little hot in the house. I wasn’t prepared to not flush toilet paper. There were no extra garbage bags to store used toilet paper in.
657710,28464743,2019-06-26,"One of the best experience I had using Airbnb! Bojan and Jelena is an amazing host and we enjoyed our stay very much. Their place is clean and tidy and had everything I needed for my 10days NYC stay, including umbrellas to cotton balls. Convenient location and so many subway line goes through nearby. The apartment is located on busy street but surprisingly the place was so quiet and noise level 0 which was great. Would love to stay here again!"
760237,36943673,2019-10-28,Two stars simply due to my reservation being cancelled on the morning of due to an emergency the host had. Sorry to this man.
713044,32857674,2021-11-06,"James and Laureta were friendly hosts! The walk to the subway was very easy. <br/><br/>The space is small—and there are no dressers, drawers, closets or hangers. We stayed for a week and had nice clothes we needed to hang for work, so this became difficult. <br/><br/>It was also very loud as there are many people in the building. We're New Yorkers and used to lots of noise, but it was still difficult to sleep through the night any day of the week."
724755,33974777,2020-11-22,Thank you for hosting me Meela! Your home is gorgeous and I appreciated you keeping my things for me even though I mixed up my check out date and came back an entire day late. That was very kind of you.
794123,40634707,2021-05-21,this place was a 5 minute walk to the subway which was really nice to have. it can get a little hot sometimes (i wasn’t able to work the thermostat) and there’s a lotta noise from the street but overall it was a really good spot for the price
299546,8704528,2019-11-26,"Marjorie is a true superhost. The room and bathroom was clean, located in a nice neighborhood. The whole apartment looked very stylish. It took a while to get to the city bus 61 and trains. There was a Ferry nearby but I only used it once since my Citymapper app showed that it's actually faster to go by MTA, which is usually around 40-60mins to midtown and other top tourist attractions. But in short, I recommend staying in Marjorie's place for the value and hospitality."
83860,850148,2019-05-04,"I am a NYC local resident, and I had to book a place to stay during my apartment renovations.  I am extremely happy that I got to stay in her cool/modern/hip apartment, which captures her stylish aesthetics to the fullest. The best thing I gained from my stay is that I even got to know her more than the great host as she is;  I was able to become her friend. She is very communicative, helpful and easy going. As a NYC local, I strongly recommend that you should stay in her place to get to know the essence of Williamsburg and Manhattan! Thank you very much for being a great host, Julie!"

587890,23105516,2019-08-17,"It was a good place to stay at! Shera provides everything you need to know in her description of the Airbnb. I had trouble understanding some instructions; however, Shera cleared up any confusion. She is definitely quick to respond to any inquires you might have. She is thoughtful  in providing you with a basket of useful information to help you get situated. Be mindful when booking this place that it is close to the subway line so it can be loud. I didn’t mind the noise and Shera provides noise cancellation plugs for your convenience. Overall, she aims to provide a comfortable experience and she successfully does that!"
733801,34373985,2019-10-26,"Dave is a very nice host who organized everything very well. Communication was perfect, the check-in was easy. The location is very convenient, in Eastern (Spanish) Harlem, close to metro (line 6), in a walking distance from Central Park. Everything was clean, the bed is comfortable and Dave provided a towel. Only one thing that I didn’t like was very thin plastic wall of the “room”, so earplugs are a musthave if you sleep is sensitive. However, I enjoyed my stay at Dave’s place."
871431,50181584,2021-09-12,Cost efficient and clean. Great spot

881481,51410905,2021-11-07,"The location is absolutely fantastic! Several superb restaurants a few blocks away (Rubirosa Pizza, Russ and Daughters) and easy access to several Subway lines. The room is pretty small though, so a nice cozy fit for 2 people!"
775299,38489046,2021-04-16,"This space was perfect for our group of 5 with 2 small children. It’s conveniently located in quiet Tribeca and a few minutes walk to the 1 & A/C/E trains. The apartment is large and clean and the kitchen was fully stocked so that we could cook for our picky kids. It’s a ground level apartment and some light was blocked by the scaffolding that’s currently up around the building but George was kind enough to give us a heads up. The apartment is still beautiful and bright! Occasionally it’s loud in the master bedroom with street noise but this is New York, it’s part of the charm. And George was thoughtful enough to leave us earplugs which we didn’t use. He was communicative and we really couldn’t have asked for a better stay. We highly recommended this apartment and look forward to returning!"
504715,19099537,2020-02-13,"Loved it ! Such a great place to call home and Troy was such a nice host ! Communication was spot on and the his local tips great too , would definitely stay again"
457084,16644599,2020-01-19,I love my time I spent at ISO’s residence. The Beige room has two beds available for you & check in was pretty easy with using a digital lock pad. One of the best neighborhoods in the city; I ventured out to Flushing Meadows Park about a 20 minute walk north (Visit the Unisphere/Globe please)  & felt 100% comfortable the whole time. They’re a lot of great restaurants & shops in walking distance. If you’re staying in NYC this is the place to be most definitely.
712294,32845010,2019-07-22,"A nice area, stays in contact. All around good host."
88340,905947,2019-11-03,Very clean place and friendly host I would come back next time.
851616,47941354,2021-03-13,"The hosts are very nice and responsive but that's about the only positive I can give. I had a really bad experience trying to get in due to the host giving me the wrong combination multiple times. Things were cleaned and put away but the sheets looked stained and not clean and then all of the surfaces, such as inside drawers or the fridge were dirty.  Also smelled of smoke.  This place is incredibly loud because all of the ambulances for the emergency service park right below the window and no sound is blocked out.  It's a really gross and loud area in general, even as far as being in the city goes. It sounds like people are shouting right outside your window all night even on the 4th floor. On top of this, there was no toilet paper when I got there and I had to go by some. There is are no helpful extras here, such as paper towels, coffee, etc.  I wouldn't recommend it but if you just need a place to stay at least the hosts are nice and never around."

685978,30531246,2019-07-29,"Fantastic place. Pictures don’t do it justice. Its a really well designed space. It’s less than 5 minutes walk to two different metro stops, which was perfect for me to get into work. It’s really a gem. The host was quick to respond to any issues (couldn’t figure out the key when I checked in and someone was there in 5 to help me out). Would certainly recommend to friends when visiting. <br/>Only thing to be aware of, is that it’s not the quietest building. It never stopped me from sleeping, but the people out back like a weekend late night party. Although, it is summer, so who can blame them!"
432566,15581948,2019-11-03,"Schöne Unterkunft in Brooklyn, ruhige Lage in schönem Wohnviertel mit vielen Restaurants in der Nähe. Verschiedene Metrostationen und die Long Island Railroad sind in der Nähe. Die Wohnung ist schön groß, mit eigenem Bad und einem sehr komfortablen Bett. Allerdings ist die Wohnung nicht so hell wie auf den Bildern gezeigt, aber da wir sowieso den ganzen Tag unterwegs waren hat uns das nicht weiter gestört. Wir würden jederzeit wiederkommen."
351466,11549838,2019-03-12,Wir waren sehr zufrieden und die beiden haben uns in einer Mappe super Tipps zum Essen und für Aktivitäten gegeben. <br/>Die Wohnung an sich ist super und es sind lediglich drei Minuten bis zur U-Bahn.

458648,16730833,2021-01-05,"This place is lovely for both a big and small family. This was my first time using the app. This amazing first time experience has paved the way for my continued use. I will definitely look to book Yves places when visiting. He is a great host. He met me upon arrival, gave me a tour to makesure i have everything that I needed and have a general idea of the area. He is exactly as rated, a SUPER GREAT HOST!"

627787,26035350,2019-04-30,"Bill’s place is easy to get to and the space is clean and tidy. The bed was comfortable but there’s definitely some noise from other tenants, footsteps mostly. The only inconvenience was the lack of towels. Otherwise we felt very safe and comfortable."
494953,18584742,2019-03-24,"It was just in front of the highbridge, in a friendly latin neighbourhood :)<br/>The place itself reminds me of a hostel as we stayed in a room while there's other rooms in the appartment.<br/>We liked the area as it's away from the tourists, and 10-15 min walk from metro. <br/>I would say the only thing that was not good is the cleaning of the appartment."
496084,18632502,2019-04-30,"It’s a great location just off Smith with all the restaurants and the subway is just close by for an easy hop into Manhattan.<br/>We had a couple of hiccups, one my fault another at the property and Triada sorted them out quickly without fuss.<br/>Look forward to coming again."

590417,23307503,2019-05-01,My girlfriend and I had a fantastic stay at Mariela’s. Her place was relatively easy to find and a brief walk from the subway; perfect for a trip to the city if you’re looking to save money! She was very flexible with our check in time. Her dog Archie is adorable and extremely well behaved. The apartment was sparkling clean. She was an extremely hospitable host and we truly felt at home. I would love to stay there again in the future.
657890,28483571,2019-02-12,"Mohammed was cool, never had problem with communication. The location is 5 minutes away from the train station.<br/><br/>It does get cold at night and you will have to contact Mohammed to turn the heater on and it takes at least 30 a hour for the house to warm up.<br/><br/>I had a bad experience with the neighbor two - three houses down who threat to call the police on me if I didn’t show her proof that I living at his location."
233319,5881122,2019-12-23,"Dominik’s house in Manhattan is such a GEM place! This apartment is located at real good location in Lower East side which is close to Subway station, Williamsburg bridge, and walkable distance to East Village and SoHo!!!!! Most importantly, condition of room was the best- super clean, stylish ( with good books, neat, and warm tone of room), and cozy which made me feel like an authentic local home in hectic city. It was a perfect getaway from busy part of the city but still approachable to any other parts of Manhattan. Also, Dominik has good sense of decorating house and really cultured. + his adorable dog welcomes you and gives more like a homie feeling :) I will definitely stay Dominik’s house again when I visit NYC soon again!!!!"
545428,21038471,2019-11-07,Nous avons été très déçus de l’appartement. Les photos ne sont absolument pas conformes à la réalité. La chambre dispose d’un réfrigérateur et d’un micro onde pour remplacer la pièce commune : salon et cuisine. Cela dit il vaut mieux vu l’état et la saleté! La chambre est spacieuse mais très sale. Le ménage n’est jamais fait. Pas de plante verte comme sur la photo. Odeur de marihuana permanente dans la chambre ce qui est insupportable. Le pire est la salle de bain qui est partagée avec 3 autres chambres. Tout est noir de saleté et la baignoire est insalubre. Bonne localisation et heureusement que le quartier est calme car nous avions une entrée indépendante dont nous n’avions pas l’autorisation de fermer la porte d’entrée donc pas vraiment sécurisant pour nos affaires. Malheureusement notre avion a eu du retard Tiffany nous a accueilli à 2h du matin je comprends que cela puisse être tard mais ce n’était pas notre volonté en tout cas nous n’avons pas ressenti d’accueil chaleureux. Nous ne réserverons pas cet appartement pour un prochain séjour à New York
635350,26741585,2021-08-20,"Been to New York several times and this is probably the most convenient and clean accommodations I've ever stayed in! Super close to train if you need to go to airport or Manhattan, park slope is a great area of Brooklyn. Also super affordable and worth it"

The location was really good, very close to subway so it was easy to reach any city easily. There are many shops, restaurants and places to eat all you want to nearby. The communication with Don was great. He respond very fast and answered all questions. I would definitley recommend Don as a host and staying in his apartment."
446154,16229585,2019-06-23,"You have to expect being left outside the building for the first night. Be cautious about the promisse of ""a cleaning lady will be waiting for you or you can go to the italian restaurant next door, my friend has a key"". The only italian restaurant is across the street, they never heard of Jay Credidio, may be Javier Gomez, apparently his other identity. I would never rent from him again, Under one identity or another"

Door code in front made getting in easy. Everything worked, and Michelle even brought up a new can opener and tupperware for me! Location is great, in Bed Stuy on the border of Bushwick — good subway access and also a lot to do within a few minute walk."
741180,35085826,2019-07-14,Geralde is an amazing host with a great heart. The space was extremely clean and ready for us before the 3 o'clock check in.

11567,44096,2020-01-18,Waundell was very kind in letting let me stay in of his bigger rooms after he found out one of his guests wasn’t coming. He seems to really care about his guests and is an easygoing guy. I felt like I was at home and that is a great feeling. Being close to Yankee stadium and the subway station was awesome.

553850,21427369,2019-09-07,"A hidden gem in Brooklyn - can’t recommend Brian and Joanna’s place highly enough. I’ve been to New York a few times, as I have friends out here, and will continue to do so. I’ll definitely check this place first to see if it’s available! It was super clean, exactly as pictured, and Joanna and Brian were attentive hosts. It’s also in a great location and a lovely neighbourhood. Thanks so much!"
5962,18152,2019-01-09,"The place is clean and you get a room with a bed. Victoria was a great host and very accommodating with check in and check out. Her cat, Gus, was also really friendly.

There is a nice little outdoor space out back for a spot of air. John’s space is very comfortable and I highly recommend it for 2 travelers."
737781,34718342,2021-11-16,"It is a hidden gem and definitely worth the stay for what you pay. Washer and dryer, plus a back yard are a must during these pandemic times. Very central location in Brooklyn to Queens and Manhattan. Two blocks from the subway is a super bonus!"

784111,39531655,2020-07-10,"We live a few blocks away from Bond Street Townhouse. When our apartment flooded, they were able to check us (and our pets!) in within a few hours. We never expected to find such a perfect convenient place so quickly, but the townhouse surpassed our expectations and provided a perfect reprieve during a difficult time for our family. Our plans changed several times, and the Bond Street concierge team was extremely flexible and accommodating. The room was clean, well-decorated, and the air conditioning works super well. The garden is lovely, and the laundry facilities were much-appreciated. Thank you so much Leonardo and team!"
214466,4823386,2020-06-29,"Fabian was such an amazing host! His response time was on point, and the place is spot-on; really clean and accessible. The area is a bit ominous at night, but it’s quite safe!"

635273,26741585,2019-08-05,WOW!!!  The room is huge and is appointed with multiple thoughtful touches.  “Super-clean” is an understatement.  I doubt my own home has ever been that clean!  Andrew and Adriana have the gift of hospitality and it’s evident in their home and their prompt communication.  Loved that it’s so close to the subway.  I will definitely check this listing first for availability on future trips to New York.
867070,49749316,2021-09-10,"Definitely recommend staying here! Yvan and Patrick are great at communicating, the location is great, and the place was very clean. <br/><br/>Just a heads up - it is on the 5th floor of a classic NYC walk-up building. <br/><br/>Thanks for everything :)"
718622,33423849,2019-06-11,Cool place if you don’t have a vehicle. Parking is a nightmare especially for someone from out of town
353816,11684682,2021-07-25,"I stayed in Anthony’s place for 1.5 months and it was great! Room is right next to the kitchen and bathroom. The room was very spacious and it’s way better to stay in a townhouse than someone else’s cramped apartment. There are no cats on the top floor, so it’s good for anyone with allergies. Would highly recommend staying here."
520791,19915657,2019-05-21,"Excellent location for those flying into La Guardia. Convenient to the N/W Train (walkable 9 blocks away) ..

814320,43161885,2020-07-06,"Melissa was very prompt to reply to any questions and even offered suggestions for places to go in the neighborhood. The condo was clean but was very sparse. There was a coffee maker, and a tv, but no bedside table.  If you don’t mind bare bones, this apartment is fine."
813157,43002696,2021-10-25,Clean and bright rental in a very central location. Emmanuel is a responsive and accommodating host.

840516,46585974,2021-05-03,Domingo was sweet and very quick with communicating at all times. The places is exactly like the photos and extremely comfortable I almost overslept everyday because I was so comfortable. The train is close by and there are plenty of stores in the area. I would definitely recommend this space to others :)
813634,43060685,2020-08-30,"Very clean and stylish place with everything you needed. <br/>The apartment is just perfect! Kitchen is clean and contains everything one needs. The bed and bath are clean and comfortable, and the rooftop was excellent with incredible Manhattan skyline views. Location is incredible. The neighborhood outside the apartment was vibrant and had a lot of life within walking distances. However, it was very quiet when you were in the apartment.<br/>Melissa had excellent restaurant recommendations and was of great help, who went way beyond to make our stay comfortable and memorable. The communication was super easy and quick and the place looks exactly like it does on the pictures. <br/>Would absolutely recommend to stay there!"
355030,11753010,2019-05-10,Overall a decent studio in a really cool neighborhood. Parking wasn’t a problem at all as long as you are <br/> willing to walk about a block or so. I read that there is also a pay for parking lot available.
688682,30786946,2019-09-01,"Amazing stay. Comfortable bed, lovely shower and all in all super clean! Would 100% stay here again!"

You'll have everything you need for the bath and bed.<br/><br/> Great location, in front of the subway, some nice places around to eat, supermarket and like 20 minutes walk distance to the Yankee Stadium!, Get to any place of Manhattan easily just crossing the street and taking the subway. Mia and Enzo are awesome."

768207,37713423,2021-02-20,"Robert was a great and very caring host! He was super responsive, and on arrival showed us the ins-and-outs of the apartment before leaving us with a mountain of yummy treats as well as some flowers for Valentine's Day. :)<br/><br/>The apartment itself offers a beautiful view, is very quiet and cozy, and on top of that we had it all to ourselves for the entire length of our stay (absolute privacy!). Overall, we felt it offered exceptional value for the price."

773497,38297641,2021-07-25,"My friend and I had a great time staying at Cynthia's place. I lived in Brooklyn for about 9 years, and wanted to visit for a week to catch up with old friends and this place was the best hub. This place was super close to the A and G subways which made it easy to get around Brooklyn or Manhattan. Even though it's close to tons of bars and restaurants, the street was peaceful and quiet. Wifi worked great for getting work done and streaming, and kitchen had everything we needed for cooking a few meals.  I would defiently recommend it to any friends who are visiting the city."
754474,36253150,2021-06-21,"Sue Ellen’s apartment was smart, spacious and well located. The unit is just steps from the A train and less than ten minutes by foot from the board walk and beach and many popular neighborhood restaurants. The backyard is truly beautiful, with luxurious outdoor seating, a fire pit and a cozy hot tub! There are lots of great beach amenities, including bikes that appeared to be in great condition (sadly we didn’t have time to ride them), boogie boards and beach towels and a beach cart (we brought way too much with us as the unit was well supplied). The apartment itself was spotless and had excellent A/C. Finally, Sue Ellen and her husband were wonderful, accommodating and non-intrusive hosts who even offered us some of their (delicious) garden vegetables. Would definitely return."
101192,1110484,2020-10-16,"This apartment is in a great location in Brooklyn. Outdoor dining, the park, and generally everything is walking accessible. Would stay again. Only downside was poor communication with the host on a plumbing visit and not communicating a cleaning person was coming nearly two hours before checkout and i was not told until i reached out myself. Some of the general details did not line up with the public page, but Greg suggests he has updated the page."
786120,39673143,2021-10-16,Great place!
810190,42661402,2020-05-08,Amazing hospitality and great check in it was a pleasure !
338559,10545027,2020-11-01,"Unfortunately, the place is not held up to good standards. When it rained, there was a leak in the roof and we had to catch the rain in a bucket. The doorhandle to the entrance kept falling off, and there were dogs in the apartment next door, who barked at all hours. The internet was also crippingly slow. The location is great, although it didn't make up for the shabbiness of the place."
773979,38355160,2021-08-10,GREAT SPOT! The neighborhood is quiet and safe with easy access to everything. Beautiful park right in front of the building. Hard to beat waking up to see the sunset from your bed every morning.
884182,51745209,2021-10-13,"Louise' s place is at a perfect location, very easy to get around with public transportation and walking distance to awesome bars and restaurants. Her place is  easy to check-in, very clean and has everything you need. Allen was also very helpful since the beginning, available at all times whenever I had any questions. Totally recommend it."
640518,27188155,2020-08-29,"Great location, lively and lots to explore. The apartment was very charming, lots of natural light in the living room. Beautiful exposed brick walls with a lovely fireplace. Bedroom and bathrooms were clean, but duvet feathers leaked out during the stay and got caught in things. The lock to the front door is also a bit loose, so closing the door on the way out is a bit difficult. Overall a very pleasant stay  and host was very communicative."
638836,26980415,2019-03-21,"The people who said this is more like a luxury hotel than an Airbnb were absolutely right. Donnihe went the extra mile in so many ways. He was generous with his time, accommodating, and made us feel like honored guests in his home.<br/><br/>This location is easy to reach on the M train,  their home is sparkling clean, and the additional amenities Donnihe provides are incredibly thoughtful and kind.<br/><br/>You're lucky to get to know such a lovely couple and enjoy New York from the quiet and peace of their beautiful home!"
169444,3445138,2019-05-27,"Terrific stay with several highlights:<br/><br/>- The location is outstanding, steps from great coffee shops and restaurants, and only a couple blocks from Prospect Park <br/>- The yard was quintessential Brooklyn, sunny and spacious. Awesome place to hang out.<br/>- Bedrooms and bathrooms were spotless, comfortable, and featured modern marble amenities.<br/>- Kitchen is terrific with all new/modern appliances and plenty of room for cooking.<br/>- Great dining-living area with tons of space for our family <br/>- The layout of the apartment is terrific, with the bedrooms and a full bath upstairs, all the living space including the kitchen (and a half bath) on one floor, and a finished basement with washer and dryer on the bottom floor<br/>- neighbors and locals were super friendly<br/>- very safe and accessible for Lyft / Uber<br/>- Beautiful large windows and floor to ceiling glass walls near the garden, tons of sunlight<br/>- Great communication from our host! Made sure we had everything we needed.<br/><br/>This place/neighborhood is awesome!<br/><br/>Hoping to return soon."
628719,26055709,2021-11-30,My boyfriend and I wanted to extend our trip<br/>To NYC and we decide to book a room with Brysen and Christian the room was very clean and had some of our favorite books to read. We are very mellow people so the room and location match our personalities.  I would recommend this room to anyone.
768733,37773215,2019-10-23,"The apartments as goos as it looks in the pictures, very clean and specious. The host meet us just in time.  Locations is also great. 5 min to subway, in the building there is Walgreens. Several bars and restaurants are located just next to place. Highly recommended."

852237,48042018,2021-10-03,"Clean, all the amenities<br/>We could want.  First day something was going on with the WiFi we called Jeremy and he came right away to take care of it!! He was awesome and super friendly. Located close walk to to a Target, Costco and grocery store. We’ll be back."
723835,33880071,2019-08-14,"Check-in semplicissimo. L’host ci è venuto incontro per strada ed è stato sempre disponibile e veloce nel rispondere per qualsiasi info. <br/>Zona tranquilla e ben servita, ma qualche strada più a nord dell’area indicata dall’annuncio. 10 minuti a piedi dal capolinea della metro Q, fattibilissimo anche se un po’ stancante con il passare dei giorni. Appartamento pulito, condizionatore ed elettrodomestici funzionanti. <br/>La vista su Harlem River merita e corrisponde a quella delle foto."
821898,44295072,2021-07-25,"Trish and Andrew’s apartment was perfect. Spotless, well-equipped, and perfectly located in a great neighborhood and close to the subway. We can’t say enough good things about it. If you are looking for a place to stay in Carroll Gardens, you won’t be disappointed."

825620,44904998,2020-11-16,"Fantastic large loft with high-ceilings and a ton of space. Huge TV in the living area was a plus. Loved the morning light in the bedroom. Russell was a fantastic host, very accommodating and easy to get in touch with. We would love to stay here again!"
688072,30748041,2021-07-18,"Clarissa is an excellent host! She is clean, quiet as a mouse, and extremely helpful and friendly. She even helped me carry my giant luggage up the stairs! The location was perfect for my needs and the value is unbeatable in the area. If you are a traveler like me who enjoys meeting locals and loves to spend their money on activities instead of fancy expensive hotels, this is the place for you."
816785,43498999,2021-09-06,"This space is so beautiful. The block is gorgeous. The location is divine. Great coffee and wine shops. Amazing bagels. <br/><br/>It felt like we were house sitting for a friend away on a trip. It felt like a lived-in space rather than some of the sterile, bare options on here. It is a cute, artsy space. The patio is amazing. You’ll love it!<br/><br/>The only downside are the beds and the bed linens. A little uncomfortable. We had three people hoping to sleep in separate beds and while three beds were listed only two were in the space. And one was on the floor."

There were also convenience stores, restaurants, and laundromat just a few minutes walk away. Stella was such a great host, quick to respond to messages and help us when we needed it (even late at night). The room is actually bigger than it looks in the photo too and those mattresses were so comfortable it made our stay there extra nice!

120694,1654929,2021-09-07,I loved staying here and Shelley is amazing!! She was very responsive to my messages and I was delighted to stay on a street with so much greenery. The block was quiet and it was nice returning to this peaceful spot after traveling all over the noisy city all day long. When I visit NYC I always have a long list of things to do and people to see so I never spend much time at the place I rest my head but I was very comfortable here when I was at “home.” Some reviewers have complained about the lack of AC but I was extremely content having the windows open and fans on during my Labor Day weekend stay. If you stay here  you must use the Moka pot in the morning before you head out for a bagel!

The owners made all steps super easy, were very accessible for any issues, which there were none, and the apartment was well-equipped for anything you might need, including laundry!  The neighborhood is the best and we e will definitely stay here again."

A very clean, warm and comfortable apartment, the only draw-back was the distance to Manhattan, but we found the local transport efficient and dependable."
616290,25072401,2020-02-19,"I stayed 2nights here. It’s great location from a subway staion, having nice bars and a yummy bagel bakery. Close to trader joe’s and target.<br/>Parking was O.K (lucky me)on the street not many spots though. The building doesn’t have an elevator but the place is only second floor. I was not pleased by smoke smell through a hallway all the time cause of my kids and not having a stove fan. But warm enough. Good place to feel NY’s night."

801012,41490532,2020-01-22,"Shera’s place is very efficient. She has notes to make my stay easy so I could  settle right in. Shera and her daughter are very welcoming and make sure I am comfortable. I let them know I was feeling cold and she quickly let me know about the heater in the room that I could put on to warm up the room a bit more. The touches are nice too, from suggestions to ordering food in the area, watching tv, to even toiletries for all that you might possibly need."
